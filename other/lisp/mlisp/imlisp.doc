THIS FILE IS  IMLISP.DOC ON <MLISP>:  HOW TO PUT MLISP ON INTERLISP.

USING INTERLISP:

LOADING FILES:  (LOAD 'SCAN T NIL)
SAVING:         (SYSOUT 'M)
RELOADING:      (SYSIN 'M)

TRANSLATING FROM UCILISP TO INTERLISP:
  (LOAD '<LISP>XFORMS.UCILISP T NIL)
  (TRANSOR 'FILE)

(PUT 'ATM 'PROP 'VAL)
(GETP 'ATM 'PROP)

^D TO TOP LEVEL
OK TO GET OUT OF EDITOR
GO TO GO FROM A BREAK
^H TO BREAK
^B TO BREAK FROM RUNNING

(BREAK FN)  BREAKS ON FN
(TRACE FN)  TRACES FN

IN BREAKS:
 ATM   FOR THE CURRENT VALUE OF ATM
 (RETURN VAL)  TO RETURN VAL FOR THE VALUE OF THE BROKEN FN
 GO    CONTINUE
 BT  BAKGAGS ALL THE FNS
 BTV BAKGAGS ALL THE FNS WITH THEIR INPUT PARAMS


THE MLISP FILES:
 SCAN
 MLISP
 MACRO
 PPRINT
 UTILS
 MINIT
 RUNFN1


THE FOLLOWING CHARS HAD TO BE LEFT OUT; NOT ENOUGH ASCII PRINT CHARS:
  (* COMMENT CHARACTER CODES LEFT OUT OF INTERLISP MLISP:
      NEQUAL,  MEMBER,  AND, 
 OR,  NOT, ^ PRELIST,  SUFLIST )


STATUS:
  WELL, RUNFN1 DOESNT WORK COMPLETELY, 
E.G. FOR I_1 TO 10 BY 1 FOR J_1 TO I BY 1 DO PRINT J;.
  ALSO, (GETSYNTAX '9 T) IS SEPRCHAR, WHICH CAUSES THE MLISP SCANNER
TO BARF AT (A=9) .
  THE PPRINT SEEMS TO BE OK.  THE COMPILER INTERFACE PROBABLY DOESNT WORK.
ALL OF THE FILES NEED TO BE COMPILED.
