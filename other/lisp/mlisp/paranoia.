Thoughts on paranoia -

Conscious thoughts during the paranoid mode:

a) leading to b) or c).

a) They are doing it to me again.

b) I have to figure this out (withdraw into myself).   I cant trust
other people with my feelings because they use them against me.

c) I'm going to get back at them.   I'm going to verify my assessment
of persecution (as being the cause for my pain).   I am showing how
they hurt me, to show that I don't do those things, and thereby show
that I am ok.   People are good if they don't do mean things to other
people.   I am going to show (and prove to myself) that I am ok by
not doing mean things, so I am going to watch for them in myself and
other people.


Hypothesis:  A person experiencing the paranoid mode (to some
degree), or using the paranoid strategy of attributing blame to
others,
	either: A) has experienced abnormally fearful situations in
his life, probably in childhood.  The pain could be either physical
pain or pain from shame-humiliation.  Note - we will use the term
pain to refer to either of these.
	or: B) is currently experiencing some constantly
fear-inducing situation, e.g., the case of partial deafness, or a
person forced to live in a strange culture in which he cannot cope.
If this second condition is the cause of the paranoia, it would seem
that the disorder would be easily removed by removing the
fear-inducing situation.

	There is some question as to whether the permanent condition
can be only physical or esteem pain, or whether it must be both.  For
example, is a child who is severely punished, but not shamed, for
disobedience likely to be paranoid, or just strict in his dealings
with other people, because his fear of physical harm is not connected
to humiliation. Or, if a child is severely shamed, but never
physically punished, will he develop paranoid explanations, or merely
be self-deprecating, because his low esteem is not connected to any
fear of immediate bodily harm.



Mental processes to be modified:

a) The hypersensitivity to pain, either shame or physical pain, must
be reduced.  It seems that a person dominated by the paranoid mode
for large periods of time in his life is dominated by fear.  I can
envision constant fear, almost a hyperactive state of mind,
"shell-shocked" from all the real persecution in the person's earlier
life. This fear needs to be reduced - perhaps through drugs that have
the opposite effect of amphetimines, which make the neural
connections in the brain more prone to fire, thus looking to the mind
like anticipation of some very important event.  The opposite effect
would be to reduce the connections' propensity to fire, thus reducing
the fear affect.  But could this be done without dulling mental
alertness?

b) The person should understand the origin of his constant fear of
pain (past history of persecution), and that his constant fear is
abnormal, and the rest of the world doesnt have to suffer it.
Hopefully this would lead to:

c) come to an acceptance of his internal pain (shame, lack of
esteem), knowing that it can be reduced in the future, and thereby
reducing the fear and the suffering from it. This is based upon the
hypothesis that half of the person's suffering stems from his actual
pain (shame), and half stems from the fear of more pain.  If he can
understand the origin of the pain, perhaps his suffering due to fear
can be reduced.

d) Owing to the constant fear, the person seems to evaluate persons
(including himself) and situation solely in terms of "meanness" or
measuring the amount of harm people do to others. He should be shown
that there are other qualities to value in other people and in
himself.  Hopefully this will allow him to not focus on measuring
persecution in other people, and also allow him to build up his self
worth by noting other qualities in himself besides his ability to not
persecute others.

e) As usual in changing patterns of behavior, the person must become
desensitized to the particular situations that cause him trouble,
e.g., parents persecuting offspring, leading to trouble with
authority figures. In particular, he must be made to see that his
first impression is of persecution of himself, and that first
impression needs to be over-ridden.

f) The desire for revenge must be reduced.  This seems to creep into
situations in which the person is showing the authority figure that
they are wrong.

g) The person should be put into a social situation where few people
really are in a position to harm him. Note - perhaps this last
measure should be undertaken first to avoid extremes in the
inevitable depression that will accompany acceptance of abnormal
internal pain.


Contributions due to theory-building -

a) We can predict that persecuted children will be prone to use
paranoid strategies to deal with humiliation, particularly if the
contemporary situation of the person contains some actual persecution
and if esteem is low. Persecution early in life leads to the
development of a persecution SAP - an automatic SAP triggered by
distress which interprets painful situations as persecutory.

b) Constant fear being an immobilizing or concretizing factor
(locking the person into use of a paranoid strategy at every possible
discomfort) can be explained by the heirarchy of SAPs and selection
of the one with the highest affect. As in most psychotherapy theory,
the person is overtaken by his emotions before he consciously has a
chance to decide on an action or evaluate the situation objectively.

c) Two types of affect activation can occur - primary and secondary.
Primary fear is fear due to unexplained current rising pain with
anticipation of further rising pain. Secondary fear is fear activated
by the activation or bringing into consciousness of a previous
situation in which fear was experienced.  (The thought of
experiencing the dentist's drill is a secondary activation of fear.
The actual experiencing of it is a primary activation.) Primary fear
is a commonly-invoked affect in a person with paranoia due to his
past history.  In the person's previous actual persecution,
situations of slight pain typically led to greater pain.  Thus, when
slight pain occurs later in life, the person automatically
anticipates further pain; this is exactly the fear affect.  By
knowing that the fear is due to past persucution and is an outdated
judgement, the person may be able to slowly change the judgement and
reduce the fear due to this interpretation.

d) Over-sensitivity to specific situations is explained by SAPs.  The
unlearning of these patterns must be through constant conscious
repetition and practice of new patterns to gradually replace the old.

e) Any return to previously persecuting (in reality) situations will
reinforce the originally correct persecutory decisions leading to the
paranoia.  These situations should be avoided.

f) The fear of pain may also be partially counteracted by situations
in which pleasure is given - physical for those physically tormented,
esteem for those shamed.  This can be explained as reinforcing a new
interpretation of situations as positive and erasing or overpowering
the old interpretations of anticipating more pain.
