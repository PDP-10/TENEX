Notes --


Chapter 1.  Introduction

	Boden's approach - both antired and red.
	antireductionist - there are certain radical differences
between the logic of purposive and of mechanistic terms.
	reductionist - purposive phenomena are totally dependent on
causal (neurophysiological) mechanisms.

	Teleological phenenomena can only be exhibited by physical
systems of a certain organizational nature.  must have models to
represent the external environnment. This organization accounts for
intensional features.  The mind should be thought of as a set of
representational models linked in certain ways.

	McD's 2 mistakes: (a) that consciousness is causally active.
(b) that purpose and mechanism are incompatible.

	Question of "what are things made of" is less important that
the question "how do events run their course".


Chapter 2.  The Concept of Purpose

	Efficient cause - (aristotle) the agency that makes a thing
move.
	Final cause - the purpose or goal of an action. Efficient and
final causes must remain separate.
	Characterization of purpose - (McD) (1) spontaneity of
movement, power of initiative. (2) tendency to persistence. (3)
variation of direction of the persistent movements. (4) cessation of
the movements upon goal attainment. (5) anticipation of the goal. (6)
repetition of effective movements, with greater efficiency. (7)
involvement of total organism.

	Purpose - the goal or end toward which that action tends, and
the achievement of which is observed to terminate the activity. Could
be mistaken, so the goal that the organism has in mind, which is
desired and believed by the agent to be attainable by means of the
activity.

	Explanation - any answer to a why question that is accepted
by the questioner as making the event in question somehow more
intelligible.
	Scientific explanation - an explanation that is justified by
reference to publicly observable facts, and which is rationally
linked to other, similar explanations in a reasonably systematic
manner.

	Mechanistic vs purposive explanation -
	Three forms of mechanism -
	(1) Mechanical - appeal to forces, Newtonian physics.
	(2) Formally mechanistic - no reference to goals or to
possible future events is necessary to their formulation.
	(3) Basically mechanistic - (strongly reductionist) even
those psychological explanations that do refer to goals are reducible
to physicochemical explanations.
	Teleological explanation criteria - (1) some prospective
reference to possible future events. (2) reference is made to
purposes or goals that are in some sense ultimate to the organism.
(3) a number of subjective psychological categories are involved
(eg consciousness, foresight, desire).

	Purposive explanation is not atomistic.  Atomistic
explanations connect independently identifiable units. Future units
may be predictable from the prior occurrence of other units. But the
future units need not be appealed to in any way for the initial
identification of the prior units, and thus are logically isolable
from them. A bird may fly for migration, fighting, or whatever. The
identification of its flight movements as an element in one of these
activities requires reference to the whole sequence.  If behavior can
only be identified as part of a pattern, it is not identifiable as
such independently of other elements. (context-sensitive).
	In mechanistic contexts, it is always possible to ask for a
further stage of mechanistic explanation at a deeper level. Purposive
explanations come to a stop, eg at instinctive goals. (or at
symbols).
	Being conscious is an activity of a subject in relation to an
object. The activity is "intensional" in nature.  A thought or
behavior is "intensional" in that it is directed on a phychological
object. An "intensional" sentence is a sentence whose meaning
involves the notion of the direction of the mind on an object. The
intensional object (the object of thought) can be described only by
reference to the subject's thoughts, such as his purposes, beliefs,
expectations, and desires.

	Strict reduction - a relation that holds between two sets of
statements in virtue of logical equivalences between the two sets.
The two must be, at least in part, identical in meaning. To show that
psychology is strictly reducible to physiology would be to show that
the meaning of every purposive statement is contained within the
meaning of a physiological statement.
	Empirical reduction - relies on factual, rather than logical,
links between the two sets of statements.  The two are neither
totally nor partially equivalent but have clearly different meanings.
All laws of the less basic science must be logically derivable from
the theoretical bases of the more basic science, with the help of
"bridging" assumptions.

	McD's mistake - postulating horme. He mistook the conceptual
connection between "desire" and "action toward a goal" for a causal
one. He assimilated final causes to efficient causes.


Chapter 3.  Behaviorist Interpretations of Purpose

	R.B. Perry - In the case of hunting for a pin, the organism
is not, strictly speaking, responding to an object or fact of its
environment.  It is not hunting for any particular pin; and can keep
hunting, even though there be no pin in its environment.


Chapter 4.  Purpose, Reductionism, and Cybernetics

	Intensionality - the system's subjective idea of the goal.
This feature is lacking in pure homeostasis.
	The reducibility of machines - Given a particular output, a
person can list the various changes in the componenets that were
involved in producing it.  In practice, he is usually unable to do
this, because of the complexity.  In principle such explanations are
available.
	Loss of information on translation from LISP to machine code
- (a) the LISP program can exhibit structural features of operation
that are lost in the machine code, eg, giving a subroutine a name.
(b) the semantic usefulness of the symbols used is lost to the
machine if they cannot be expressed in machine code. The more the
programming language superficially resembles a natural language, the
more likely that one may read surplus meaning into the program which
is not represented by any precise instructions that can be executed
by the machine.
	No program is strictly reducible to a physical description of
any machine, particularly because the same program may be run on a
variety of machines. The overall structure of performance (J.A.
Deutsch), rather than the electronic causes, is crucial to explaining
the performance of machines.

	Cybernetic explanations, teleological in form? (1) The only
way to express certain significant facts about some programs, eg GPS,
is to use language such as attaining goals. (2) Machines dont yet
have ultimate goals behind their purposes; instead, they have the
purposes of the programmer at the bottom. Even then, we know that
performance can always be explained mechanistically.
	Chisholm - pointed out logical peculiarities in intensional
sentences. Minsky - the model that underlies any knowledge cannot be
defined independently of the system's interests in or relations with
the world; leads to circular definitions or to ambiguities about
essential features. Also, one cannot identify purposes or ideas or
other objects of thought without ascribing them to some psychological
subject. Example - if a person is trying to find a potato, it does
not follow that it is trying to find a vegetable of the family
solonaceae. Incidental consequences of intentional actions, whether
or not they are foreseen by the agent, are "unintentional" because
they are not represented in the particular subjective model of the
goal that is functioning so as to guide the act. Thus, not how the
world is, but how it is represented as being, is crucial to the truth
of some statements about the machine, and such statements qualify as
intensional.

	The very same movements can be involved in a bird's migration
or his escape, but the action is different because the intention is
different.  Conversely, to identify an intention, or an act of will,
one must specify the action toward which it (necessarily) tends.
Therefore, the relation between intention and action cannot be a
causal one, because cause and effect must be contingently, not
conceptually related. Reference to intentions explains behavior not
by specifying its causes, but by placing the action concerned in the
psychological context of the agent's subjective world, by locating it
in his mind. Knowing a man's intentions enables one to understand his
actions by relating them to his idiosyncratic beliefs and desires.
	A machine's intention or goal is not conceptually
identifiable with any causal condition or physical state of affairs
in the machine. Similarly, a single programming instruction is not
identifiable with any such state of affairs, although it is only by
virtue of specific causal mechanisms that the instruction can ever
actually be carried out. Once a phenomenon has been characterized as
goal-directed, one cannot explain units of behavior or performance in
cause terms but must continue to use the language of intention.
	It is impossible to have any psychological commerce with a
thing except by means of some model or representation of it; ie,
experience is intensional. One cannot convey one's experience or
knowledge of a thing independently of one's model of it.  Pointing to
an object only indicates the object, not characterizes it. Shifts
from formal to material mode are easily made (representations of
objects or objects in reality). Indeed, the fact that man's self
description includes mind and body indicates his model of himself
includes a mind and a body.

	Computer simulation - aimed at representing psychological
theories. Consequences of these theories are so complex that they can
usually only be ascertained by actually running the program. Only
certain features of the simulation should be stipulated as logically
equivalent to behavioral features; need modelling rather than
mimicry. Given that detailed machine performance is functionally
equivalent to behavior as represented by a psychological theory, the
explanatory power of the program will equal that of the theory
itself.
	R.L. Gregory - the distinction is between representing events
directly by the states of the system, and representing symbolic
accounts of real (or hypothetical) events. Real events always occur
in a continuum, but symbolic systems are always discontinuous.
	The human brain is a largely analog system, which can both
represent changing information directly (and thus function in real
time), and process information symbolically.
	As regards the phycial functioning of the brain,
investigators are in much the same position as one who encounters an
extremely computer of unknown design.


Chapter 5.  Purpose, Instincts, and Natural Goals

	Purposive explanation involves stopping points as basic
theoretical concepts. These stopping points must involve reference to
an instinctive impulse or motive.
	Hedonistic theory postulates feelings of pleasure and pain
which the organism constantly tends to approach or avoid.
	Ryle - Pleasure - (1) a mood or feeling.  (2) an end in
itself, the thing strived for; conceptually connected with purposive
behavior; does not connote any pleasurable feelings in this sense.
	Question of whether pleasure is the prime end or merely an
accompaniment of action. Hedonistic theories derive the statement
"pleasure as the sole motivator" from the ambiguity of the word
pleasure.  Purely physical, immediate pleasurable sensations are not
enough.
	McD - a feeling or emotion cannot be a causal power moving a
person to act.  However, it can be a clue to the instinctive
impulses, or indicators of the motives at work in us. Fear, pity, and
pride correspond to the basic motives of flight, parenting, and
self-assertiveness.  These instinctive motives underlie and
ultimately explain intentions.
	Common stopping point in explaining behavior - when the
questioner can fill in the rest of the chain down to basic
instinctive motives.
	Instinct - not the bodily activity, but the nature of the
objects and situations that evoke it, and the nature of the goal, the
change in the situation in the object or the animal's relation to it,
to which the instinct impels.
	Use a teleological method of defining instincts.  It follows
that instinctive behavior is not necessarily fixed or rigid in its
motor aspect; it may be very flexible and show intelligent adaptation.
Instinct and intelligence are complementary rather than opposed.
	If instincts are very general goals directing all behavior,
then the details of motor activity must be explained in terms besides
the natural goal defining the instinct concerned.
	It is essential to the concept of purposive behavior that
there be alternative means available to the end; if not, then the
objective criteria of purpose cannot be satisfied; it's just a SAP.
It is the many means that give the single goal its constancy.
	Identifying instincts - can rely on the concept of a natural
goal, including evolution and the level of abstractness of the goal.
	Instinct - an innate disposition to perceive, and pay
attention to, objects of a certain class.  This requires an inborn
specification of objects of a certain class.  Such a specific object,
may be likened to a key that unlocks a door.  The key and the lock
are unlike, but are made for one another; each implies the other and
is useless without it. The certain class cannot be abstract, because
abstract classes can be defined only by means of language, not by a
list of perceptible characteristics.
	Anger would be a natural instinct to have, if defined as the
obstruction of a positive goal.  Also, interest would be natural; one
might expect that an evolutionarily successful purposive organism
might have a tendency to maximize its learning with repsect to
relevant objects in the environment.  Situations of high
informational redundancy (boring) are a disincentive, and organisms
tend to prefer informational novelty.
	McD - motive = instinct = drive.
	Automatic behavior - eg dove cowering at the form of a hawk -
this is not goal-directed; there is no variation of means;
obstructions are not overcome; the behavior is either arrested by
them, or it continues unchanged in the new inappropriate environment.
However, slight marks of purposiveness are found even in the lowest
animals.
	Teleological behavior traits cannot be attributed to any
simple hereditary mechanisms (need goal structures, etc). In general,
the genetic endowment (the genotype) determines the limits within
which the various observable features (the phenotype) will lie.
	Miller, Galanter, Pribram - Plans are executed because people
are alive.  As long as people are behaving, some plan must be
executed.  The question moves from why plans are executed to which
plans are executed. Choice of alternative means to a given end is
influenced by beliefs about the particular situation involved, and by
individual preferences for certain strategies. The basic stopping
points are plans, which may be far removed from instincts.


Chapter 6.  Sentiments and Simulation

	Sentiment - a system in which a cognitive disposition is
linked with one or more emotional or affective conative dispositions
to form a structural unit that functions as one whole system.
Sentiments are conative, cognitive, and affective.
	Each sentiment has a life-history, gradually built up.  When
any one of the emotions is repeatedly excited by a particular object,
there is formed the rudiment of a sentiment. Sentiments become
complex due to the number of instincts (emotions) that are excited by
one intensional object, and the complexity of the object.
Socialization adds these complex sentiments, and facilitate the
cognitive, largely linguistic representation of these intensional
objects. McD denied the possibility of an absolute discontinuity
between instinctive motivations and purposive activity.  If a new
goal is accepted as a purpose of the individual, it must be linked
with the goals already directing the person's behavior. The linkage
may be purely cognitive (John believes dancing would impress Mary).
Once a form of behavior is adopted, the goals and motivations driving
it may change (John becomes a professional dancer). Sentiment is a
dispositional concept, rather than one marking any particular mental
occurrence.
	Sentiments can be named in terms of their emotions, or their
core objects.  The emotional stresses the subjective feeling-tone,
while the conative (instinctive) stresses the ultimate motives and
observable goal-seeking activity typical of the sentiment.
	General characteristic of sentiments and their uses - List of
sentiments tells which intensional objects most important, and their
associated emotions that are activated.
	Complex emotions can be activated (excited) by either objects
or general properties of objects. The emotions act as signs or
indicators of the instincts aroused, feeling as a sign to the
organism itself, bodily expressions as indicators for others.
Emotions can be based on instincts (primary or complex), or on the
success of the ongoing activity (derived), irrespective of the goal
(eg anger as a measure of obstruction). Skill in tasks is rewarding
because of its connection with the sentiment of self-regard. Tastes
(dancing) are for actions or strategies, whereas habits (may be
conditioned) concern movements or low-level actions.
	Boden - how to model McD's theory.  basic goals, each showing
a specific action tendency; conflicts of goals either with
simultanaity, or ordering. Want to have a number of processes
shouting how important they are at the same time, then evaluate which
is most important. Emotions need to have anticipatory signals that
they are going to activate (maybe they rise slowly).  This is so the
master sentiment can ultimately watch them and head off emotions that
it is supposed to subdue.
	Derived emotions (confidence, hope, anxiety, despair) based
on the success of any goal.  They influence by redirecting or
abandoning the goal. These cognitive judgements can influence the
conative nature of activity, by changing the strategy.
	Actions tendencies concerning a core object can be
generalized to linked objects.   Love can be transferred from Mary to
Fido, although easier if there is a positive association from Mary to
Fido. This allows for a more subtle application of emotions or
motives.
	Simulation of a sentiment for a friend or an enemy depends on
a cognitive representation of their situation: if either were to slip
on a banana, the action tendencies would be different. In general,
the cognitive representations at the core of the sentiment will
crucially affect the operation of the component action
tendencies.(?).


Chapter 7.  Purpose and Self

	The selection of the goal that is to direct an organism's
behavior may always be primarily dependent on the current situation,
and therefore the organism may look like it is constantly at the
mercy of the world. But a creature capable of varied purposive
activities may show a degree of overall teleological consistency, in
that much of its behavior appears to depend on enduring purposes of
its own that are largely independent of environmental changes.
	Integration of the organism's personality, avoiding conflicts
of basic instincts, can be by the development of one sentiment over
all, eg love of a child or political obsessions.
	Potentially moral qualities must be abstract in character;
love of justice, not love for a particular individual.
	Mechanisms of socialization - (1) internalization of moral
rules; (2) extentions of the egoistic sentiment, eg identification of
the self with school.
	Conscious purposes are crucial to moral action or volition;
the essential and immediate effect of all volition is the maintenance
of a presentation at the focus of consciousness.
	McD tried to explain action against the strongest desire, as
when a weaker, more ideal motive prevails over a coarser, more
primitive one. Volition is just a special complex case of conation,
made possible by the systematic organization of the innate and
acquired dispositions.
	Volition - the supporting or reinforcing of a desire or
conation by the cooperation of an impulse excited within the system
of the self-regarding sentiment.  ie, the self adds its own power or
emotional motivation to a particular action, and this added
motivation is enough to override a simpler yet powerful emotion such
as anger.
	The development of self renders the organism less dependent
upon the environment; it is a movement towards complete
self-determination, towards conduct that stems from conditions
totally within the mind.
	The individual's behavior is idiographic (predictable only
from a knowledge of that individual) rather than nomothetic
(predictable from general laws). Prediction requires detailed
knowledge of the individual, in particular of his specific vision of
his self as he is and as he aspires to be.
	Goal-seeking that is independent of the self (or self-esteem)
(whether conscious or not) differs from that directed by the self,
for only the latter may be inflenced by all the complex cognitive and
conative systems comprising the self-regard sentiment. Boden calls
this a distinction between behavior that is, and behavior that is
not, under the control of the self.
	Program needs to have both a model of what the self is, and
what the self strives to be. The overall plan of the system's
activity must be available and must be complex enough for
sophisticated self-evaluatory and self-regulatory behavior.  These
purposes will be especially crucial in performance. All sentiments
subordinated in some degree to the self-regard sentiment? The two
self-regarding instincts: self-display, domineer, lead, assert
onself; self-subjection, defer, obey, follow.
	In order for a moral rule which is used to be any more than a
superstition when used, it must be logically linked to beliefs,
especially good if it is linked to self-regard.
	Dissociation - lack of integration of personality, tendency
to work at cross purposes within the self.
	the Personality - a community of monads (independent
systems), linked together.  Each monad is a psychic individual, a
dynamic conative unit.
	McD - every case of purposive activity not consciously willed
by the self was seen as directed by a subordinate personality and as
evidence of a certain degree of dissociation.
	To simulate, one must specify the manner and form in which
information, commands and requests at one level in the system are
transmitted elsewhere; also, in the systems, subsystems are able to
induce concealment or refuse access to information which other
systems require to achieve their aims. (I am not sure about this;
maybe just interrupted before they can try to achieve their aims.)
	If there were no frustration of purpose in action, there
would be no consciousness.
	The terms of conciousness cannot be ignored, because
conscious perception, thinking, and striving are necessarily involved
in the overcoming of frustration of purpose.  They are conceptually
connected with such activity, not merely contingently connected with
it.


Chapter 8.  Purpose, Consciousness, and Intensionality

	Purposive behavior must always be explained in terms of the
general categories of consciousness.
	The teleological function of affective states is to signify
the conative impulses currently excited or incipiently aroused by an
intensional object.  Analogously, a programmer would have to ensure
that internal signs of the activation of various subprograms were
available to the master program, if efficient teleological control
were to be achieved.
	Only if one can link plans, purposes, and ideas with causal
mechanisms of a specific sort can one understand how it is possible
for purposes to influence the bodily behavior of a psychological
subject. In them, final causes may be said to influence efficient
causes, and the mind may be said to direct the purposive actions of
the body.
	Thought or motor behavior that is conscious in the strongest
sense is under the direct control of the self; actively attended to;
guided by precise foresight of the goal; open to introspection: its
component features are verbally describable by the psychological
subject.
	Contingent connection - a matter of hypothesis or empirical
fact that might conceivably have been different.
	Conceptual connection - one that follows logically from the
criteria of the concepts involved and so could not conceivably have
been different.
	If there is a cause, and an effect, the two must be separate
phenomena, separately identifiable. Causal explanation involves the
assertion of functional dependence between two independently
identifiable variables.  If consciousness causes purposive action,
then the two must be separately identifiable and contingently related
(they are not).
	Wittgenstein - an inner process stands in need of outer
criteria. It is because publicly observable features are intrinsic to
(criterial of) psychological concepts that communication on
psychological matters is possible. (ie, if we couldnt see them, we
wouldnt be talking about them). And external behavior reflects
internal behavior to some extent.
	Now try to prove that behavior intrinsic to purposiveness is
intrinsic to consciousness. Try to show these terms are related:
perception, idea, instrumental activity, voluntary action, intention,
desire, psychological subject, and purpose.
	Differential responses to particular environmental features
are required to guide the choice and application of means to a given
end, and to direct the overall strategy. To adjust behavior in this
way is termed perceptual discrimination.
	Instrumental or motor behavior can be called purposive only
if it shows appropriate, nice adjustments to environmental obstacles.
The organism must be able to perceive the achievement of a goal
state. Therefore, this discrimination must depend on an internal
condition. The internal condition must represent the external
condition that it is supposed to reflect. Of course there is always a
large range of possible representations.
	Thus, the purpose involves the use of cognitive concepts such
as perception and idea. The concept of perception is particularly
appropriate where behavior is flexible and where difficulties are
overcome with a certain economy. Stereotypical behavior may be
triggered by a series of discriminations related to stimuli, but the
bahavior is unresponsive to unusual features in the environment; this
is clearly different from purposive behavior which varies
continuously to reach the goal. Stereotypical behavior can be
attributed to an evolutionary purpose, but not an individual purpose;
the greater the flexibility of the behavior, the more it may involve
the purposes of the individual, rather than the class (of robins).
Voluntary behavior is characterized by the organism being thought of
as an individual, and its goals being associated with its
self-concept.
	The greater the flexibility of behavior, and its independence
from the environment, and the variety of behavior across individuals,
the more justified one is in speaking of the organism's goals and of
its perceptual activity in goal-seeking.
	Purposiveness and consciousness conceptually linked: implies
that the vocabulary of consciousness are essential for describing the
psychological structure of behavior in terms of the intensional
dependencies between psychological variables.
	C.I. Lewis - The primary significance of knowledge lies in
its guidance of action: knowing is for the sake of doing. And action
is rooted in evaluation; the being must assign comparative values,
and it needs knowledge for this. Conversely, only an active being
could have knowledge and assign values to anything beyond his own
feelings; the being must want to alter some part of the future in
reality.
	Cognition - a reaction of the mind of the subject upon
impressions made by objects on its body.
	Conation - the direction of the mechanical processes of the
body by the purposive activity of mind. Conative concepts specify the
various goals toward which it actually strives.
	Denial of horme - use the concept of plan. A plan is neither
matter nor force.  Just a pattern. All plans, whether cognitive or
conative (?) require real physical energy driving specific causal
mechanisms for their actualization.
	Must stress that the sense in which action is caused by
purposes is different that the sense in which movements of the jaw
are caused by electrophysiological activity in the brain.
	Knowledge, in the form of cognitive representations (ideas),
serves as a guiding function, and does not add any special energy to
the system.
	Cognitive disposition - the state or process of the mind when
thinking about something. The totality of cognitive dispositions make
up knowledge. Every object of which the mind can think must have its
corresponding disposition or representation.
	Increased motor complexity must necessarily involve increased
cognitive capacity. The dispositions form a vast and elaborately
organized system. Perceiving a horse involves the activation of all
those cognitive dispositions that are linked with the sense
impressions received from the horse.  A young child on seeing a horse
for the first time might receive a sense-impression very similar to
mine; but his perceiving would be a vastly simpler process than mine.
	Perception is an activity of the knowing mind. It involves
the operation of cognitive dispositions in the interpretation of the
sensory material, the latter action as the occasion for perception
rather than constituting the perception itself. The meaning implicit
in perceptual discrimination cannot be furnished by the sensations
involved.
	The most fundamental function of mind - the guidance of
bodily movement so as to effect changes in our relations to the
object about us - changes of a kind that will promote our own welfare
and that of the race. Thus, perception is affected by one's interests
and goals: attention to one aspect of the perceptual field rather
than another is crucial to concentrated effort and is a function of
one's purposes.  Perception is selective, and is actively controlled
by inherited and acquired central regulatory factors. We perceive
objects, not visual images.  We perceive more than patterns; objects
are more than patterns, and are categorized (modeled) by percipient
organisms largely according to the uses to which the organism can put
them, given its particular repertoire of behavioral skills. The
patterns and images can provide information important to the entity's
survival if they can selectively activate internal models or cognitive
dispositions that include the nonvisual object properties (properties
that cannot be seen) concerned. The model is a lock; the activating
pattern is a key.
	The cognitive dispositions or locks are largely linguistic in
form. EG, apperceptive synthesis, the perception of similarity
between objects that had previously been regarded as different.
Verbal symbolism fixes ideas for the thinker, since its generality
frees the subject from attending merely to the sensory properties of
the objects of thought. Stability of free ideas in the mind allows
for greater steadiness of behavior.  When the power of representation
of an object has been attained, the attention is not so readily drawn
off from it by irrelevant sensory impressions.
	Craik - Internal models - must have similar
relation-structure to that of the process it imitates. The nervous
system only has to produce combinations of excited arcs, not physical
objects.  The brain may model environmental or abstract features that
cannot be predicated of the models themselves. A model of a red-hot
poker need be neither red nor hot. But there must be some
regularities in terms of which these features of the poker can be
mapped onto certain features of the model, thereby enabling the
organism to behave appropriately toward red-hot pokers.
	Logical properties not so hard to model.  What is difficult
is the simulation of the stimulus generalization involved in
commonplace discriminatory behavior, and the creative generalizing of
apperceptive synthesis. Simulations need to show how one thing can
model another thing apparently radically different from it.
	Property list approach is limited in the detail of the
distinctions it can make. Instead, have a set of primitives, and
build up descriptions from them. Want an arbitrarily complex
discription or recognition to come from a fixed complexity mechanism.
One way is by a repeated application of a fixed set of
pattern-recognition techniques.
	General interpretative (discriminatory) ability can see a dog
from many angles and distances, and still know it is the same dog,
even though the sum of physical stimuli is unique.
	To show how a model is used by a machine is to know what
interpretation the model has for the machine. Or rather, it is to
show what model it is that the machine has, for the concept of model
is itself intensional.  It cannot be defined without reference to the
way it is used by the system under consideration. There is thus no
genuine distinction between a particular system's model of X, and
that system's interpretation of its model of X.
	Appropriate response to the environment (eg, ability to
answer questions about it) is a criterion of having a model in the
required sense.   What is regarded by an observer as a correct
description of a scene - whether spoken by another man or printed out
by a machine - rests on what the observer can do with the
description, given that he finds (or imagines) himself in the scene.
In general, an appropriate response is one that enables the organism
to pursue its various purposes with some success.
	The crucial point is that the intensional system is organized
so as to function successfully by way of its models.  Thus, the
concept of model cannot be defined independently of the way the model
is used in the interests of an information-processing system.
	McD - Perception and memory and discrimination are built up
from primitive operations of simple apprehension or awareness of
objects, affirming, denying, and comparing.
	Claim of knowing introspectively ones own representations
cannot be accepted without qualification.
	The most important part of consciousness - the reference of
consciousness to an object; it can only be defined or described by
naming the object of which the subject is thinking at the moment. Ie,
not the physical sensations, but the organization of the sensations,
and of the mind's own constructs, into a representation of the
physical object that the organism uses to deal with the object. Does
not have to be verbally expressible, as in a dog's understanding of
space.
	Not how the world is, but how the subject conceives it to be
(represents it as being), is crucial, for this is what determines the
truth of falsity of intensional propositions.  And this too detemines
the validity of purposive explanations.
	Intensionality provides a basis for regarding different
machines (with differing internal models) as analogs of unique
psychological individuals.  For, insofar as the internal models
differ, the machine's performance cannot be explained in terms of
laws about machines in general, but must be referred to the details
of information storage within each individual machine.
	By virtue of its internal models, many sentences describing
the robot's performance would share the characteristic logical
features of intensionality. Similarly, the logical characteristics of
indeterminacy, failure of existential generalization, nonextensional
occurence, and nonimplication of embedded clauses are all applicable
to some sentences describing the robot's performance.
	Intensional (psychological) explanation, as opposed to
mechanical explanation, of a robot's behavior requires an
understanding of how the inner representation of model (the robot's
concept) directs the performance of this individual robot. Thus,
although the distinction between psychological subject and object can
be made only within the terms of a psychological vocabulary (this
type of vocabulary is necessary), we can understand how it is
possible that this intensional distinction may be based in a purely
mechanistic system.
	A representation that generates recognition in an indefinite
number of cases allows for the selection of appropriate response in
an infinite class of situations, thus showing teleological
flexibility.
	In sum, to ascribe purpose to an organism is to ascribe
consciouness to that organism in some degree. Purposive behavior
involves consciouness, beliefs, desires, perception, and ideas.
Psychology is, in principle, empirically reducible to physiology.
Final causes require efficient causes to affect behavior. It is a
particular type of physical organization - one involving models
representing the world - that allows one to speak of behavior as
being directed by thoughts of nonexistent objects and by purposes
impossible of achievement.


Chapter 9.  Purpose and Mind.

	McD - goals are cognitive variables and purposes are conative
ones. But the near synonymy of these terms as commonly used reflects
the fact that the explanation of any purposive action must empoly
both cognitive and conative terms. Cognitive terms define the
organism's knowledge and thereby set general limits to the goal
states that the creature is capable of having in mind. Conative terms
mark out those goal state toward which the organism actually strives.
	The potentiality of affect, which functions so as to indicate
the specific conative dispositions aroused at a given moment, may be
said to be an aspect of mental structure; but the occurrence of
affect is more properly regarded as mental process. An organism's
intensional world is determined by the detailed nature of the
structure of the mind: the objects and relations of which it can
think, and the desires and intentions that it can connect with those
objects. A complete description of mental structure must include
reference to the executive capacities of the organism in its
environment; ie, must include reference to the behavioral embodiment
of the mind in question.
	Self - a cognitive representation of the organism contained
within the organism. The child's idea of his self develops in large
part by accepting the ideas of himself that he finds expressed by
those about him.
	At least two ideas of self: model as he believes himself to
be, model as he would like to be.  Each of these represents the self
as a purposive system capable of pursuing certain ends.
	Empirical reducibility does not imply that mental properties
are really physical, that there is no real distinction between them.
	Two opposing truths about personality - though it acts as a
unitary agent, it is built up by a gradual integrative process.
	Freedom and voluntary action must involve reerence to the
action's being somehow determined by the self of the acting
individual.  It is because dogs have no self-image or self-ideal that
their behavior cannot be regarded as truly voluntary, or as the
action of morally responsible beings. Volition can achieve action
against the strongest desire because the conative powers of the
self-regarding sentiment come into play as the person strives to live
up to his self-ideal.  Ie, self-regarding sentiment is most powerful.
Action which, given the agent's mental structure, could have been
guided but was not, is nevertheless action for which the man may be
held morally responsible.
	Unpredictability of human behavior due to: (1) historical and
environmental factors, such as past conditioning, physiological
conditions; SAP behavior is more subject to environmental changes
than planned behavior, and thus less predictable from just the
agent's goals. (2) variation in organism's beliefs. (3) self-image.
	Indeterminism in physics is irrelevant to the psychology of
action.
	We can predict action in terms of physical laws.  But then
the actions are predictable only as described in physical terms (the
hand moved from a to b) and not as psychological phenomena (he tried
to close the window). Extensional vocabularies making no distinction
between subject and object logically cannot express the specifically
intensional dependencies between psychological phenomena that are
essential to action.
	McD - The representational power of ideas cannot be based
purely in mechanism.
	The relation of mind to body is somewhat analogous to the
relation of program to machine.  But it is more closely analogous to
the relation between an internal model and the various stimulus
patterns and motor sequences that are systematically linked by way of
the model.  To express this linkage, intensional vocabulary is
required - but only a causal mechanism so organized as to generate
the linkage within the system's overall performance can function as
the material embodiment of the model in question.
	Mechanisms whose behavior is determined by models may be
regarded as psychological beings.  All psychological commerce with
the environment - or with the structure of one's own mind - is
intensional in nature.
	In general, the purpose of any activity is the directive
representation of the goal state that the organism has in mind. If
purpose is interpreted in this way, rather than as the attainment of
the goal considered as some future event, there is no special
difficulty in understanding how behavior may be directed by
unrealized or unrealizable purposes.
	The direction of one's attention is a function of one's
conscious purposes at the time.  The effect of attention is not only
to select and stabilize a particular focus for thought, but to allow
for a more detailed analysis.
	A conscious purpose is one of which one is introspectively
aware, or which one can recognize introspectively fairly readily.
	Full self-consciousness requires that there be some
representation of the simpler representation of the self.  In
general, any model or level or representation can have knowledge of
itself only by way of a model of itself.
	To describe the self-regarding sentiment as powerful is to
say that its purposes have priority over others.
	The representation models within an intensional system may
reasonably be said to determine its behavior.
