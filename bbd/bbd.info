		     THE SUMEX BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM


	[New users please note:  BBD needs to know that you are
	interested in new bulletins before it can tell you about
	them.  The procedure is simple.  Run the BBD program,
	type "Add *", and then "Quit" to get out.]


	BBD and its companion programs (POST, BBCHECK, BBREAD, BBNEWS,BBDPRO)
were written at SUMEX-AIM at the Stanford University Medical Center
during the Spring of 1976 in an attempt to further the efforts of our
nationwide user community to collaborate on common projects and share
information and techniques.  The project is also an experiment in human
engineering of computer programs and user profiles.  It is also in use
at IMSSS (at Stanford) at USC-ECL and in the near future at USC-ISI
(both on the ARPA network).  The programming language used is TENEX
SAIL, and it is exportable to other PDP-10 computer sites running the
TENEX or TOPS-20 operating systems.


		     Bulletin-board organization

	The BBD programs can support any desired number of bulletin
boards on any desired number of different file directories.  SUMEX-AIM
has a main bulletin board (called the SUMEX bulletin-board) for
announcements, system status, bug fixes, new versions of subsystem
software, changes to the EXEC, etc., several project bulletin-boards for
intra-project communications, one for system-staff use, and one to hold
the documentation on new developments in PUB, the document-processing
language written at the Stanford AI Laboratory.

	Bulletins are numbered in ascending order by topic.  Topics are
ordered alphabetically, and may have subtopics (separated by periods)
nested to any depth.  Topic-creation privileges are restricted to
certain users called bulletin-board managers.

	Each bulletin has an expire date.  Expired bulletins are removed
automatically by a batch job which runs every night at SUMEX.


			User interest profiles

	Users who express an interest in any or all of the topics on
any bulletin board are notified of the arrival of new bulletins, either
by mail (the default at SUMEX), or by running one of the other bulletin-
board programs.  BBD itself has a News command, BBCHECK types a one line
[You have new bulletins on...] message as appropriate, BBNEWS types a
directory listing of the new bulletins, and BBREAD types out the new
bulletins.





	BBD knows which bulletins are new for each user, because it
records the date and time when the user last asked to see the new
bulletins on his "interest list" of topics.  A BBD user may say that
he wants to see all new bulletins posted, or he may say that he is
only interested in bulletins posted under certain topics.  He does
this by modifying his interest list via the Add and Drop BBD commands
(type "Help add" to BBD for more information).  Initially each user's
interest list is empty.

	It is recommended that every new BBD user add all topics
to his interest list initially, then drop those he doesn't care about.
If this is done, topics created after that point will automatically
be added to his interest list (unless they are subtopics of topics
he has dropped).


			Help features

	BBD offers several kinds of help.  The Help command offers
general hints.  If a command name is given as an argument to Help, BBD
types out an explanation for that command.  The user can type ? at the
command prompt (which is *) and get a list of commands.  He can type
? in the middle of a command or topic name and find out which commands
or topic names begin with as much as he has typed.  For example "D?"
gives a list of all commands that begin with D.  Elsewhere, a ? will
print out an explanation of what is expected next, e.g., the user types
"Type ?" and BBD indicates that a list of (bulletin) numbers is what
is wanted here.

	The BBD command processor resembles that of the TENEX EXEC
or TOPS-20 command processor in order to be familiar and helpful to
its users, and command names were chosen accordingly.


	The bulletin boards on which BBD operates are comprised of sets
of sharable files.  Thawed access in TENEX/TOPS-20 allows simultaneous
reading, writing and appending allowing several users to use the
bulletin boards in various ways with a minimum of interference.

	BBD commands act directly upon the bulletin board files,
so their effect is seen immediately by other BBD users.  They do
not, for example, submit requests to a system autojob to do the
writing on the bulletin board.

	BBD does not impose a topic structure on a set of existing
message-format files, it manages its own set of shared files in its
own format in order to allow bulletin board programs to respond
quickly to user requests, minimize interference from other programs
and allow readers to see immediately the effects of the writers.

		      User profile options

	In addition to their interest list of topics which is kept
on each bulletin board, users may specify, in a profile file on their
login directory, 1) a bulletin-board to be connected to when entering
BBD, 2) whether to be notified by mail or not when new bulletins
arrive, and 3) whether BBNEWS should give the directory listing of
new bulletins only once or repeat until the user has had a chance
to read them with BBD or BBREAD.
----------
NOTE: March 23, 1979 --
	This profile can be created by running <NEWSYS>BBDPRO. The file
it creates will be named (BBD.PROFILE);n, n = version number, usually 1.

	A typical profile file  could  look like the following three lines:
Connect: sumex.bbd
Notify? Yes
Repeat news after BBNEWS? Yes
------------
		  Keeping track of new bulletins

	There are three programs (briefly described above) to assist you
in keeping up with new bulletins that are posted on topics which you
have added to your interest list.  BBCHECK tells you in one line which
of the bulletin boards have new bulletins on them.  BBNEWS prints on
your terminal the topic, current bulletin number, author, length (in
characters), expire date and subject of each new bulletin on each
bulletin board.  This directory listing of new bulletins looks like the
message you would get if you had asked to be notified by mail when new
bulletins arrive, except that the bulletin numbers may be different.
The bulletin numbers are subject to change as new bulletins are added
and old ones expire, so it is recommended that you use the BBNEWS
program rather than the message you receive in your mail file to find
out what a new bulletin's current number is.

	The BBREAD program will type these new bulletins out at your
terminal, and then record the date and time at which you ran the
program.  (The latter also happens in BBD when you give the News command
or the New subcommand to the Directory or Type commands.)  The bulletin-
board programs will assume thereafter that you have seen all bulletins
posted before that time.

	At SUMEX-AIM, or any site with a LOGIN.CMD feature, you may have
either of these three programs run automatically for you each time you
login.  After ensuring that the output of the program will be typed out
at your terminal (this is done at SUMEX by inserting a "Redirect - tty:"
line and a blank line in your LOGIN.CMD file), insert the name of the
program in the file and it will be run automatically for you as part of
the login procedure.


			Posting bulletins

	Use the POST program to post bulletins on any of the existing
bulletin boards.  POST may be run alone or from the BBD program via the
Post command.  Run the POST program just as you would SNDMSG.  It can
post bulletins and also send local mail.  There are three things you
need to be aware of:  1) When you see the "To:" or "cc:" prompt you may
give either usernames (to send messages) or bulletin-board names (to





post bulletins) or both, 2) a bulletin-board name always ends with
".bbd", 3) POST will ask you for a topic name and an expire date, both
of which may be defaulted, when you ask it to post a bulletin.

	For example:

To: SUMEX.bbd
cc: Kahler

will post the message you write on the SUMEX bulletin board as a
bulletin, and send a copy of it to Kahler in the form of a message.

	When you are asked for a topic, you must choose from what is
there.  Type ? to get a list.  Type ? in the middle of the name to get
your remaining possibilities at that point.  The ESC key will recognize
one field at a time.  The default topic is "Other", which is a temporary
repository for bulletins which do not yet have a topic.  Ask your
bulletin-board manager to create new topics for you.

	The default expire date is one month from now.

	POST has other control characters for use in addition to those
SNDMSG provides, including ^K to abort and return to BBD (when called
from BBD).  Type ? immediately after any of POST's prompts for help.

	A copy of your bulletin is saved on a temporary file called
MESSAGE.COPY on the directory you are connected to, also on the file
SAVED.BULLETINS, if one exists on your login directory, otherwise it is
saved on SAVED.MESSAGES, if it exists.

	It is up to you to keep backup copies of important bulletins you
post.  POST will do that automatically if you create the file
SAVED.BULLETINS on your login directory.

	If you have a file called EXPIRED.BULLETINS on your directory
(protection 770404, like your MESSAGE.TXT file), copies of bulletins
authored by you will be sent there when they expire.


			Reading bulletins

	When you run BBD, you are connected by default to the main
bulletin-board.  (You may change that default.)  If you type ? to the *,
you will get a list of those commands which are available to you.  The
Help command will give you help on these.  "Help" alone prints an
introductory message, which you should read through at least once.
"Help directory" gives you help on the Directory command.

	You may use ? in the middle of words, to see what options remain
to you.  For example, if you type "D?" you get a list of the commands
which begin with D.  If you type "Connect ?", you get a list of the
bulletin-boards on the system, to which you may connect.





	The directory command will print out all of the topics and
bulletins on the connected bulletin-board, as in the EXEC, but you must
connect (use the Connect command) to the other bulletin-boards to see
their directories.

	The News command gives you a directory listing of the new
bulletins on the connected bulletin-board, provided that you have set up
your interest list with the command "Add *".  For more about interest
lists type "Help add" to BBD.  The BBNEWS program issues the News
command on each of the bulletin-boards.

	The Type command, by contrast, expects bulletin numbers rather
than topic names.  Type "Type ?" or "Help type" if you forget.  Look
up the bulletin numbers with the Directory or News commands.

	The Directory and Type commands have subcommands available.
Enter subcommand mode, as in the EXEC, by following the command with a
comma and a carriage return.  You will be prompted with a double star
(**).  Then use ? for help with the subcommands as you do with the
commands.  The Directory subcommands let you see the author, length,
creation date, expire date, subject, etc. of each bulletin listed.
The Type subcommands allow output to be diverted to a file (or the
lineprinter) in message format with the topic name included in the
bulletin header.  Both sets have new-bulletins-only and interest-
list-bulletins-only subcommands.

	The Copy and List commands, for copying bulletins to a file
or listing them on the lineprinter, are merely instances of the
Type command with preselected subcommands.
