			Bulletin-board file formats


	This is a description of the format for the files used by
BBD and its companion programs.


BULLETIN-BOARD.NAMES file

	The BULLETIN-BOARD.NAMES file is a text file read by each of the
bulletin board programs every time they start up.  The speed of TENEX
SAIL I/O allows us to read this file as part of the initialization
process and avoid the necessity of recompiling all programs every time a
bulletin board is to be created or destroyed.

	The first line of the file contains a list of the directory
numbers (in decimal, for INTSCAN's sake) of those users who are to be
managers of every bbd.  These users only are allowed to use the BBD
Initialize command, which creates bulletin boards after they have been
entered in this file.  (If such a user should accidentally Initialize an
already existing bbd, just delete the new versions thus created of the
existing files, the existing files are not touched.)

	The second and each succeeding line of the file names a bulletin
board (which must always end in ".bbd"), the directory it will be found
on, and a list of users (decimal directory numbers) who are to have
manager privileges on that bbd.  You may put spaces and tabs liberally
between these three items so that they line up in columns.

	The file may be put on any system or user directory and should
be protected for read access only.  Put the name of the file in the
GETBBDNAMES initialization routine in BBD.COMMON under compile switch
for your site (see the file BBD.SITE).  BBD.COMMON is required by every
bulletin board program during SAIL compilation except the small one,
BBCHECK, which must be told separately where this file may be found.

	Here is a copy of <BULLETINS>BULLETIN-BOARD.NAMES at SUMEX-AIM:

				286
SUMEX.bbd	Bulletins	49, 296
AI.bbd		Aihandbook	170, 310, 26, 148, 316
CSD.bbd		Levin		26, 142, 424, 129
Dendral.bbd	Dendral		22, 114
Hydroid.bbd	Wiederhold	11, 26, 310
Lore.bbd	Bulletins	49
Mainsail.bbd	Mainsail	111, 128
Molgen.bbd	Molgen		28, 238, 149
Mycin.bbd	Mycin		148
Protein.bbd	Engelmore	38
PUB.bbd		Bulletins	328, 140
SECS.bbd	Auxsecs		203





	The seven files comprizing each bulletin board are described
below.  Filenames are of the form name-BBD.ext, where "name" is the name
of the bulletin board and "ext" indicates the function of that
particular file.  Sample filenames given in parentheses are those of the
SUMEX bulletin board.  The PUB bulletin board would consist of files with
names like PUB-BBD.BLT and PUB-BBD.USER .  The .BLT and .TR files are
text files, the other five are binary.


Bulletins file  (SUMEX-BBD.BLT)

	Text file containing bulletins in message-format, except for a
line at the beginning containing the bulletin delimiter (a # at the
beginning of a line), bulletin number and length in characters, e.g.

#1:  (Length 187)
13-DEC-76 15:45:13-PST,187;000000000000
Date: 13 DEC 1976 1545-PST
From: KAHLER
Subject: Sample bulletin

	Text goes here.

-------

"#" is not allowed to be the first character in any line of a bulletin.
A space is inserted before the "#" in such cases before the bulletin
is posted.



Bulletin pointers file  (SUMEX-BBD.PTR)

Word		Contents
0		N + 1, where N is the number of bulletins on the bbd
1 to N		File pointer (7-bit byte count from beginning of
		 file) to the # at the beginning of the bulletin



Topic records file  (SUMEX-BBD.TR)

	Text file, contains 5-line topic records for each topic,
including topic name, topic number of father, topic numbers of sons,
bulletins posted, users interested.  All numbers are DECIMAL.

#2	Other			topic number, tab, topic name
1	33, 76			father, tab, sons
123, 124, 125, 126		bulletins under this topic
286, 343, 72, 11		users interested
				blank line





Topic pointers file  (SUMEX-BBD.TP)

Word		Contents
0		M + 1, where M is the number of topics on the bbd
1 to M		File pointer to the # at the beginning of the topic
		 record



Date file  (SUMEX-BBD.DATE)

	Fixed-length records, one per bulletin.
First word of record = bulletin number * daterecordsize.
Currently daterecordsize = 20 (octal).

Word	Contents
0	Bulletin number
1	If non-zero, bulletin is deleted
2	Directory number of author
3	Creation date, TENEX internal format
4	Last read date
5	Number of reads
6	Expire date
7	Directory number of last reader
10	Not used
11	Not used
12	Not used
13	Topic number
14	Not used
15	Not used
16	Not used
17	Not used

Words 13-17 were originally reserved for additional topics to which
this bulletin could belong, pending a satisfactory resolution of
the issues involved.  Currently a bulletin can be filed under one
topic at a time only.

At the moment I think that the best way to post a bulletin under more
than one topic is to introduce another level of abstraction (logical
bulletins) between physical bulletins and topics.  Any given physical
bulletin may then have more than one logical bulletin pointing to it,
so that a new logical bulletin may be created each time it is desired
to file a bulletin under another topic.  The bulletin numbers that the
user would see in the directory listing would be logical bulletin
numbers.  Physical bulletins would be removed from the bulletin board
when the last logical bulletin pointing to it is deleted or expires.

Another much needed feature is "examined" bulletins (a la MSG).  This
would require doubling the record size in this file to 40 (octal) words
to provide one bit per user for each physical bulletin.  This originally
was considered too much overhead in terms of file space.





User file  (SUMEX-BBD.USER)

	Page 0:  "Last news date" table, indexed by directory number,
		 of date/time when user last read his new bulletins.
		 (At USC-ECL, this table occupies pages 0-1)

	Page 1:  "Last post date" table containing creation date of
		 newest bulletin on user's interest list, maintained
		 by POST.  (At USC-ECL, this table occupies pages 2-3)

Each user has a one-word entry in each table.  These two numbers are
compared whenever a bulletin-board program wants to know whether the
user has new bulletins.

This does not allow individual classification of bulletins into "alert
the user about this" and "we know that the user has already seen this"
categories as examined bulletins (above) would.



Lock file  (SUMEX-BBD.LOCK)

Word	Contents
0	Bulletin board write lock (normally -1)
1	Date/time when last locked
2	Directory number of last owner of write lock
3	Count of times write lock has been locked (bbd written upon)
	since last expunge.  Could be used to decide whether to expunge

10	Bulletin board expunge lock (normally -1)
11	Date/time when last locked
12	Last owner of expunge lock

20	Date/time of last notify

100	Count of times write lock had to be broken (as when somebody
	locks the lock and never restores it, hasn't happened yet)
101-500	Directory numbers of users who had the write lock too long


In the light of experience, only one lock (the write lock) is necessary
as long as a flag is kept with it that would be set at the beginning of
the expunge process and cleared at its successful completion.  The flag,
if set, would mean, "do not attempt to write even if the write lock is
available or timed out", indicating that an expunge was aborted before
it could clear the flag and that things might be messed up.  The only
expunge errors that have ever occurred have been harmless "directory
full" errors when trying to create scratch files, which is the first
step of the process.  These errors rarely occur anymore.

If a bulletin-board program ever complains "Error during last
expunge..." or "Can't get bulletin-board lock", use VIEW or another
FILDDT-type program to examine and/or reset the bulletin-board locks in
words 0 and 10 above.
