Subject: Release of Tenex 1.34
To:   TENEX-SITES:

Tenex 1.34 is now ready for distribution. The bulk of the relevant
files may be found in [bbn]<134-tenex>. Current sources for
Sysjob, Checkdisk, Dluser, Ulist, etc. are located in [bbn]<sources>.
A new version of the Exec is also being released at this time, the
files residing in [bbn]<exec>. I would like to emphasize that
subsystems are NOT being released at this time and that therefore
the files in [bbn]<sources> are not necessarily current, other
than those obviously system-related. A full release of subsystems
is planned for a few weeks hence.

The file [bbn]<134-tenex>134.doc contains some descriptive material
concerning the various changes made to the monitor in this release.
Copies of all messages sent to this distribution list concerning
the release may be found in [bbn]<134-tenex>134-messages.txt.
Any patches that may be necessary will be recorded in 
[bbn]<134-tenex>patches.gripes.

Please direct questions/comments to me. Happy holidays!
Don

Subject: Additional release documentation
To:   TENEX-SITES:

I have expanded [bbn]<134-tenex>134.doc to include descriptions 
inadvertantly left out at the time of the release. The 3330 statistics
code, mods to Setnm, and the Sysjob 'Setname' command are discussed.

Subject: 1.34 bugs
To:   TENEX-SITES:

The file [bbn]<134-tenex>134.bugs has been created for the purpose
of collecting all messages that I receive pointing out problems in
the release. If/when fixes become available for distribution as patches,
they will appear in [bbn]<134-tenex>patches.gripes and this distribution
list will be notified of their existence. The message(s) prompting
the fix will then be deleted from 134.bugs.

Subject: 134 BUGS
To:   TENEX-SITES:

Ed Taft has been working actively to bring up 1.34 at Parc. During
his labors he has discovered some bugs and supplied fixes which
I am making available to all of you via [bbn]<134-tenex>134.bugs.
As we are in the throes of moving computers to new buildings and such,
the correctness of Ed's contentions have not necessarily been verified
by us and are therefore not being released as patches at this time.
Nonetheless, considering the source, the probability is high that
they are correct, and therefore should be considered carefully when
working on 1.34 at your own site.
