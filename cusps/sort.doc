	SORT VERSION 6A - CHANGES FROM VERSION 6

	SORT VERSION 6A COMPLETELY REPLACES SORT VERSION 6. THERE
	IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE OPERATION OF SORT VERSION 6A, BUT IT
	IS LOADED WITH LIBOL VERSION 6A. (THE CHANGE TO LIBOL DOES NOT
	AFFECT SORT.)





	SORT VERSION 6 - CHANGES FROM VERSION 5

	COPYRIGHT 1973, DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP, MAYNARD, MASS.


0.	SUMMARY OF CHANGES

	SORT VERSION 6 COMPLETELY REPLACES ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS
	OF SORT.

	THE ONLY CHANGES BETWEEN SORT VERSION 5 AND SORT VERSION 6
	ARE SEVERAL BUG FIXES.



1.	NEW FEATURES

	NONE.



2.	BUG FIXES

2.1	SORT NOW TAKES ACCOUNT OF ITS HIGH SEGMENT SIZE WHEN
	DECIDING HOW MUCH CORE TO ASK FOR A SORT.  THE HIGH
	SEGMENT SIZE IS SUBTRACTED FROM AVAILABLE CORE BEFORE THE USUAL
	ALGORITHM IS APPLIED.  THIS PREVENTS IT FROM BOMBING WHEN A CORE
	ARGUMENT IS GIVEN (R SORT N) THAT IS EQUAL OR NEAR TO CORMAX.
	(SPR 10-8661)

2.2	IN RARE CASES IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CAUSE YOUR INPUT FILE
	TO BE DELETED BY DOING ^C THEN START AFTER A
	SORT HAD STARTED.  A PATCH HAS BEEN INSERTED TO PROHIBIT
	THIS.
	(SPR 10-9360)

2.3	CSORT.MAC HAS BEEN FIXED SO THAT IF SORT IS CREATED AS IN
	SORT.CTL, SORT WILL PRINT THE TIMING INFORMATION
	AT THE CONCLUSION OF A SORT.


3.	DEFICIENCIES

	NONE KNOWN

4.	INTERNAL CHANGES

4.1	VERSION6A DOES NOT NEED ANY CHANGES TO CONFORM TO DATE-75.
