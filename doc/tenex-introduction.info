TENEX EXECutive Commands                            Page   1



     Communication with  the  TENEX  EXEC  takes  the  form  of  a
dialogue  in  which  the user gives a command, the system performs
the desired action, and then waits for a new command.  When  TENEX
is ready for a command, it types "@" at the start of a line.


^C - Control C - interrupts  whatever  is  happening  and  returns
     control  to TENEX for a new command input.  Used to establish
     initial contact  or  to  start,  to  start  over  retyping  a
     command,  or to interrupt a running program.  Thus, if output
     is madly scrolling off the screen, it may be interrupted with
     ^C.


     We will show commands by capitalizing the part the user  MUST
type,  usually followed by additional characters that the user MAY
type (shown in lower case).  TENEX recognizes a command as soon as
enough  is  typed  for  it  to  be  unique.   All commands must be
terminated by a carriage return, which will be shown as 'CR'.

Escape: An important character is the altmode or escape character.
     It  is  labelled 'ESC' on most of our terminals and is at the
     upper left side of the keyboard.  It  is  typed  to  instruct
     TENEX  to  try  to recognized what has been typed and to type
     out the rest.  If the partial type-in is not yet unique  then
     TENEX will output a bell (the terminal will ding).  Thus, the
     user may type part of a file name or command and ask TENEX to
     supply the rest by typing escape.  We will show escapes typed
     by the user as '$' below.

Control Characters: When typing a command, TENEX patiently accepts
     each   character   typed  without  doing  anything.   Control
     characters signal the system  to  do  something  immediately.
     Control  characters  are  shown by preceeding them with an up
     arrow, e.g., ^C, ^A.  They are  typed  by  holding  down  the
     control  key  (on  the  left  side  of the keyboard) and then
     typing the character.  Thus, Control  is  like  a  shift  key
     except that there is no "control lock" key.

          The most important control characters are the following:

     ^C   says "stop what you're doing and get me to the  EXEC"  -
          see above.

     ^A   At any time while typing, if a typing error is made,  ^A
          will  cause  TENEX  to  forget the last character typed.
          Usually a backslash will be typed followed  by  the  bad
          character.   Example:  if the user types A followed by B
          followed by ^A (control A) followed  by  C,  the  system
          will echo 'ABbC' and it will be just as if 'AC' had been
          typed (you will get used to it).

     ^R   Retypes the current line.   After  several  control-A's,
          the line may become unreadable.  ^R will retype the line
          cleaned up.


---FILE DESIGNATORS---

     Many of the commands refer to file designators or just  files
for  short,  so  we describe them now.  A file designator has many
parts of which several are important immediately:

          <directory>name.extension;version

The "directory" is the general place under which all of  a  user's
files  are  listed.  Most of our directory names are the last name
of our users plus we have some directories named  after  projects.
If the directory is left off, the system will assume the directory
name the user logged in as.

The "name" is the next part of the file  designator.   Names  (and
extensions)  may  be  up to any 39 letter and digits.  The name is
frequently all that need  be  typed  to  refer  to  a  file.   The
"extension"  is  a  way have having several related files with the
same file name.  The name may be thought of  as  a  person's  last
name,  while  the extension is the first name.  Thus we might have
DOE.JANE and DOE.JOHN.  The "version" allows us  to  have  several
copies  of  a file with otherwise the same name (Jane Doe, I   and
Jane Doe, II ?).  The  system  will  usually  assume  the  highest
version  number  if  it  is  left  off  (with  certain  desireable
exceptions noted below).

Examples of File Designators:

     REPORT1.;1
     REPORT1.;2
     REPORT.RNO;1
     <BLACK>BANANA.;1

     LPT:      (special designator meaing the line printer)
     TTY:      (special designator meaing the terminal)

---COMMANDS---

@LOG$in (user) USER-NAME$ (password) PASSWORD$ (account) NUMBER CR

     Each user has a user name  (usually  her  last  name)  and  a
     password.   We  all  currently  use account number 1.  Recall
     that the user types what is underlined, the system types  the
     rest, and the '$' stands for the escape character on the left
     side of the keyboard.  Note that escape causes the system  to
     recognize  the  rest  of  the LOGIN command and to prompt the
     user for the next thing to be typed.

     This is the first command that the  user  should  type  after
     hitting the first ^C.  The shortest form of the LOGIN is

               @LOG USER-NAME PASSWORD ACCOUNT CR

@LOGOut CR 

     Used to sign off from the system.  After logout the  terminal
     will not respond until another ^C is typed.

@SYstat CR

     A nice command that shows how long the system is up,  who  is
     on,  and  what  they are doing.  See what your friends are up
     to.

@DIRectory CR

     Shows on the terminal a list of all the files in  the  user's
     directory.   If  the  list  gets too long for the screen, one
     approach is to let part of the list go by, and  then  quickly
     hit ^C to stop it.

@DELete FILE CR

     Tells the system to delete the named file from  disk.   Picks
     the  LOWEST  version number if the version is left off.  When
     the user logs off (or EXPUNGEs) the  deleted  files  go  away
     forever  (although  there may be back up copies on tape - ask
     the operator).

@UNDelete FILE CR

     Before the user logs out or EXPUNGEs, deleted  files  may  be
     brought  back  with  UNDELETE.   Most usefull (in addition to
     mistakes) if the user wishes to delete all versions of a file
     and then bring back just the latest one.  Example:

          @DELete MEMO.;* CR   ("*" stands for "use everything")
          @UNDelete MEMO.; CR  (system picks latest version)

@TYpe FILE CR

     Types a file on the terminal.  May be stopped with ^C.

@LIST FILE CR

     Lists a file on the line printer - wait until the EXEC  types
     out the welcoming '@' before trying anthing else.

@SUBSYSTEM NAME CR

     The user start the various subsystems like TECO and RUNOFF by
     typing the subsystem name followed by carriage return.

@LINk NAME CR

     This creates a link  between  the  user's  terminal  and  the
     terminal  of  the  person NAMEed such that anything output to
     either terminal also shows up on the other.  Example:  assume
     that  Pat  is  in  TECO and Dick links to her (by @LINK PAT).
     Dick then types on his terminal and this typing is  shown  on
     both  his  and her's.  So far this will have had no effect on
     Pat's TECO work, and if Dick then breaks the link Pat can  go
     on  with  no  interruption  to  the  TECOing  (except maybe a
     control-R to retype her current command line).  If Pat  wants
     to  talk  back,  however,  she may hit ^C to get to the EXEC,
     type comments to Dick by starting each line with a  semicolon
     so  that the EXEC will ignore it, and then @CONTinue the TECO
     program after the link is broken by either her or Dick.

@BReak CR

     Used by any party to a link to break the link and return that
     person's terminal to normal.

@;comment...

     While in the EXEC, any line  starting  with  a  semicolon  is
     ignored.  This is useful when talking to someone via a link.

---MORE COMMANDS---

     The commands given above form a basic set that will allow the
new  user  to  get started.  However, after some experience, it is
recommended that  the  user  get  the  "TENEX  Executive  Language
Manual"  and  read  the  following  pages.  Eventually, the entire
manual should be read several times for complete proficiency.
