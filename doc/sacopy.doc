SA-10 3330 Disk Pack Copy Program
T. Rindfleisch
10/12/77

This program is for copying or verifying formatted 3330 disk packs
attached to an SA10 DEC memory port/IBM channel interface.  It includes
error correction for ECC correctable data errors and retries for other
uncorrectable errors.  It also overlaps cylinder-at-a-time disk I/O with
buffer comparisons.  Three modes are available:

   COPY		A source pack is read and a destination pack is written.
		After writing each cylinder, the destination data is
		read back and compared against the input data.

   FAST COPY	A source pack is read and a destination pack is written.
		No read-back verification is done.

   VERIFY	Source and destination packs are read and the data
		compared.

For all read operations except verification read-back in COPY mode,
correctable errors are accepted after printing the status and sense
data.  NRETRY (currently 5) attempts are made to correct other more
serious errors, including uncorrectable data checks.  In COPY mode, up
to NRETRY attempts are made to get a perfect copy to the destination,
i.e., without correctable, uncorrectable, or more serious errors.  In
this latter case, if multiple correctable errors are encountered, only
the first is reported in detail.  A summary of the total number of
retries is printed with an appropriate message if recovery is not
possible within the retry limit.


1)  Operating Instructions

=>   At start-up, the program prints a herald and asks for the mode
specification ("C" for Copy, "F" for Fast Copy, or "V" for Verify) and
for the source and destination logical drive numbers.  For safety, it
checks to be sure that input and output drives have only the minimum
required access enabled.  If access is incorrect, the operator is asked
to correct it.  You are also asked if you want details on correctable
errors including the sense bytes.  If not, you are given only the
address of the error and are notified of the number of retries required
to get a perfect output copy in COPY mode.


=>   Several special characters are provided for editing, control and
status information ($ = ESC):

   DEL or
   RUBOUT   Aborts current type-in and waits for revision

   ^C	    Aborts current copy task and restarts at initialization
	    sequence



				  1
   ^D	    Breaks the current copy task and enters DDT.  The current
	    task can be continued by typing $P (assuming AC's and
	    programs control variables have not been inappropriately
	    changed).

   ^S	    Prints the current elapsed time, the current cylinder being
	    processed, and the total number to be processed.

=>   Status information is also available for light watchers.  Location
100 contains counters showing progress made:

	LH - number of cylinders yet to be copied
	RH - number of cylinders copied so far

Enter 100 in the console Address Switches and, for the KI-10, be sure
the Exec Paging switch is on.  The display will appear in the memory
indicator lights.

=>   At completion of the copy process, a message is printed along with
the elapsed time in the format MM:SS.S.  You can expect the following
times for operations on double-density packs:

	Copy		about 13:0 min.
	Fast Copy	about 8:45 min.
	Verify		about 8:45 min.

=>   During the copy process, if I/O errors are encountered, a message
is printed giving the SA10 status information and the drive sense data.
Following is an example of such a message for a correctable error:

    !!! OUTPUT I/O ERROR at 3:3.8 min.
    INITIAL Status for device 302:
       LENGTH ERROR + UNIT CHECK   {translation of SA10 status bits}
    Physical drive A, logical drive 2, cylinder 275, head 4, record 2
    SENSE DATA:
       08 00 40 00  78 13 24 53    {hexadecimal printout of 24 sense
       01 13 00 04  02 1A 00 00	    bytes}
       09 00 05 0C  08 00 00 00
       DATA CHECK + CORRECTABLE    {translation of bytes 0-2}

=>   In the COPY and VERIFY modes, input and output (read-back) buffers
are compared word by word.  If a compare error is found, the source
word, destination word, and XOR between them is printed out in octal.  A
maximum of 5 compare errors is printed out.  If more exist in a buffer,
the first 5 are printed followed by a total count.

2)  Special Operating Instructions

Two entry locations are defined for SACOPY:

	4000	Enters DDT
	4001	Enters copy program (normal starting address)

It is occasionally necessary to process a single cylinder of data, e.g.,
after an unrecoverable error it may be desirable to do some kind of hand
correction.  Two routines are provided for this:

	RDCYL - read a cylinder
	WRCYL - write a cylinder

These routines are invoked from DDT by RDCYL$G or WRCYL$G and after
completion will return to DDT.  If source and destination drives have
previously been specified, these are used.  If these are to be changed,
set INIFLG to 0 before proceeding. 

Each routine will ask for a cylinder number.  This should be entered as
a decimal number or may be defaulted to a previously specified cylinder
number by typing <esc>.

RDCYL reads the specified cylinder into RDBUF.  WRCYL writes the
specified cylinder from RDBUF and reads it back into RBBUF.  Error
correction and recovery works as in the other copy modes.


3)  SACOPY Parameters

The disk format, number of buffers, and other copy parameters are
specified on page 3 of the program:

  NCYL	  Total number of cylinders per disk (815 for double density
		3330's)
  NUCYL	  Number of user accessible cylinders (808 standard)
  NSCYL	  Number of system-used cylinders (809 total - these include
		the 808 user cylinders plus 1 cylinder of spare tracks)
  NSURF	  Number of surfaces (heads or tracks) per cylinder (19 for
		3330's)
  NRPT	  Number of records per track (5 for 3330's)
  RECL	  Number of words per record (512 for standard SA10)
  NBUFRS  Number of parallel buffers for copy process (limited by core
		available.  Each buffer pair takes 97280 words)
  NRETRY  Number of error retries before failure
  MXDIFP  Maximum number of compare differences to print per buffer
  TIMOUT  Time-out interval for a disk operation
  LITES	  Location of light status display

4)  SACOPY Assembly

The program is assembled straightforwardly and should be linked with
SAEDDT.  It should be initialized by starting it once - this will set
up address limits and entry location variables and enter DDT.  At this
time the symbol table name should be specified and aa break point should
also be set which is used to cause DDT to be entered on various BUG's.
Following is an example:

@START
DDT
SACOPY$:
BUGADR(BUGCHK)$8B
^Z	
@SAV ... SACOPY.SAV
