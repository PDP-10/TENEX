                               a
                       program to transfer
                     PDP11 DOS DECTAPE FILES
                          to and from
                          TENEX FILES.






	PIP11 is a TENEX MACRO program which will read and write DEC-
TAPES which created useing the PDP11's Disk Operating System.



		    COMMANDS


COPY 		(from) INFILE/Switch  (to)  OUTFILE/Switch

	Copies an OLD file to a NEW file . Both the OLD and NEW files
maybe TENEX or DOS files. But both OLD and NEW files can not be on the
same DEC-Tape.
	Switch is used to specify the BYTE SIZE for the transfer. If no
Switch is used then a default BYTE SIZE will be used for opening a file.
The Switches must always be used when copying a TENEX file to a DOS
file. Default BYTE SIZE for DOS file a determined by the EXT of the file
File which have the EXT of BIN,DAT,LDA,OBJ,REL, and SAV are opened for
BINARY mode transfer. All other EXT are opened for ASCII transferes.
TENEX default BYTE SIZES are determine by the BYTE SIZE in which the 
file was created. Therefore new files and Non-Directory Devices cannot
be assigned a default bytes size. The current solution to this problem
is to assign a NEW file a BYTE SIZE accordding to the BYTE SIZE of the 
input file. This works fine except for when a ASCII Input file was made
with a BYTE SIZE of "36" which is the case with many file created by
an Editor. The best solution is to always specify the BYTE size for
all TENEX files. Copying directly to the a Terminal (TTY:) or Line-
Printer is done with the /A switch.           

	
DELETE		(file) FILE
	DELETEs any file DOS or TENEX. TENEX file are marked for deletion
by the EXEC EXPUNGE command. DOS file are actually deleted from the   
DEC-Tape.


DIRECTORY	("DOS" filelist) DTAN:FILE,DTAN:FILE,...
	Prints the Directory of a DOS DEC-Tape. Filelist may be null
in which case the directory of the last DEC-Tape MOUNTed will be given.
The filelist may be on multiple lines. The command is not started until
a confirming Carriage Return is typed. The both Name and Extension of
a file name may be a "*" in which case the proper file group will be
list in the directory.


EXIT		(to EXEC)
	Returns you to the EXEC.


MOUNT		("DOS" DTAN:) DTA1:
	MOUNTs a DOS DEC-Tape and reads in the  DOS Directory. A DEC-
Tape must be mounted before any file may be copyed to or from it.


UNMOUNT		("DOS" DTAN:) DTA1:
	UNMOUNTs a DOS DEC-Tape. A tape should always be unmount when
you are done with it. The UNMOUNT command copies the directory in core
onto the DEC-Tape. Should are different DEC-Tape be MOUNTed on the same
UNIT before the OLD DEC-TAPE is UNMOUNTed. The Directory on the new DEC-
Tape may be over-written !!!!!

		     
ZERO		("DOS" DTAN:) DTA0: PRO,POJ
       	ZEROs a DOS DEC-TAPE. The Directory of a formmated DEC-TAPE is
initialize to DOS standard format including the PROgrammer PROJECT numbers
which must be know to read a Tape on the PDP11 but not the PDP10.


		COPY Mode Switches

"A"		=ASCII 7 bit chars are transferred
"B"		=BINARY one PDP-11 word to one PDP-10 half word
"D"  TENEX only	=DATA Mode one 11 word to one 10 word 16 bit transfer
"P"  TENEX only	=PACKED Mode two 11 words to one 10 word 32 bit transfer
"N"  TENEX only =NUMERIC Mode Byte Size 1-36   "N1" to "N36"




		How to use PIP11

1.	Get a formmated DEC-Tape. It may have TENEX or DOS files on
	it from previous use. If the DEC-Tape is a has a TENEX DIRECTORY
	on it then it must be ZEROed before DOS files maybe put on it.

2.	Mount the DEC-Tape with WRITE/ENABLED if you plan to write any
	file onto the tape.

3.	Get a terminal and LOGIN to TENEX


4.	TYPE the following in the EXEC

^C
pip11 cr.

	PIP11  ***  PDP-11-DOS-DECTAPEs to TENEX  ***  Vs.   JUN-30-74

*(Command or ? for Help)
*?
ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
COPY
DELETE
DIRECTORY
EXIT
MOUNT
UNMOUNT
ZERO
*


5.	Now type the commands of your chose;. Use $(ESC) for noise
	words and "?" for help where ever a command is expected. REMEMBER
	that all DEC-Tape must be MOUNTed and should be unmounted when
	you are finished.
