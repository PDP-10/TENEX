The following is a brief list of the data files and descriptions of
programs used to handle daily and monthly accounting data.  Various data
files in ACCOUNTS are used to drive the accounting functions:

ACCOUNTING DATA FILES
---------------------

   FACT.<date>		Contains details job transaction statistics.
			Also contains entries from CHKPNT to document
			disk usage and CPU usage.

   SPOOLER.<date>	Contains printer spooler transaction data.  These
			are renamed from <SYSTEM>SPOOL. by CHKPNT.

   SYSTEM-WATCH-DATA.<date>
			Text files containing details of system usage
			over 20-min intervals.  Output is produced by
			SYSWAT.SAV run under SYSJOB.  SYSWAT is an
			extended version of WATCH.F4.

   COMPRESSED-SYSWAT.<date>
			Contains 20-min averages of system loading and
			job statistics

   NAMES.TXT		Contains all user names and valid accounts

   PROJECT-NAMES/ACCOUNTS.TXT
			Contains information defining user communities,
			projects associated with communities, accounts
			associated with each project, and project
			allocation data.


ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS
-------------------

   <SOURCES>
   =========

 ACCRUN.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>ACCRUN.SAV
   Constructs batch control files for processing a month's worth of
   accounting.  These are invoked by RUNFIL on MONTHLY-ACCOUNTING.RUN.

 ACCSUM.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>ACCOUNTING-SUMMARY.SAV
   Processes <ACCOUNTS><month>.ACCT to organize system usage and file
   data by community/project/user.

 DALLOC.SAI => <CMILLER>ALLOCA.SAV
   Assists in adjusting disk allocations within a project by keeping
   a running total of changes and total project allocation.

 CHKNAM.SAI => <CMILLER>CHECK-NAMES.SAV
   Checks the consistency of NAMES.TXT with directories actually created
   on the system.

 CMPCOM.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>C-COMMUNITY-USAGE.SAV
   Reads COMPRESSED-SYSWAT.<date> files and produces line printer plots
   of diurnal community and project usage data.

 CMPWPL.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>C-WATCH-PLOTTER.SAV
   Reads COMPRESSED-SYSWAT.<date> files and produces line printer plots
   of diurnal system loading, drum usage, and overhead data.

 CMP-DATA-IN.SAI
   Common routine to CMPCOM and CMPWPL for reading COMPRESSED-SYSWAT.<date>
   files.

 CMP-PLOT-PROC.SAI
   Common plotting routines for CMPCOM and CMPWPL for generating printer
   plots or text files suitable for Calcomp plots through NMPLOT

 COMPRS.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>SYSWAT-COMPRESSOR.SAV
   Reads SYSTEM-WATCH-DATA.<date> text files and compressed them into
   binary COMPRESSED-SYSWAT.<date> files.

 DIRPRG.SAI => <OPERATOR>DIRECTORY-PURGER.SAV
   Scans all directories and tallies file usage by community/project/
   user messaging users whose projects and personal directories are
   over allocation.  Option exists to archive files from such directories
   to bring projects back under allocation.

 DIRXCP.MAC => <CMILLER>DIRECTORY-EXCEPTIONS.SAV
   Scans all directories on the system an compares parameters against
   "standard" defaults.  Directories with other than standard parameter
   settings are noted in an output text file.

 FILAGE.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>FILE-AGE-DISTRIBUTION.SAV
   Scans files by project and plots a histogram of the fraction of the
   files which have not been accessed as a function of time in the past.

 NIHTOT.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>NIHTOT.SAV
   Similar to ACCSUM except this program scans a sequence of files for
   monthly usage and tallies total usage by community/project/user.
   This output is used for the annual report.

 PRTACC.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>PRINTER-USAGE.SAV
   Processes <ACCOUNTS>SPOOLER.<date> to tally user printer usage by
   project.

 PSWSCN.SAI => <CMILLER>DIRECTORY-LOGIN.SAV
   Scans directory information for all directories and prints users and
   passwords which have not logged in since a given date.  Output is
   organized by community/project/user.

 STREW.SAI => <ACCOUNTS>STREW.SAV
   Scans statistics file produced by ACCSUM and creates individual
   project files with usage data for users in each project.  Used for
   distribution of accounting information to users every 3 months or so.

 SYSCSH.MAC => <ACCOUNTS>SYSCSH.SAV
   Scans FACT files and tallies system reloads with estimated downtime
   as well as TYMBASE crash data.

 WATCH.F4 => <SUBSYS>IWATCH.SAV & <SYSTEM>SYSWAT.SAV
   Observes system loading and prints a text summary of system, job,
   and subsystem statistics.  This program is available as <SUBSYS>IWATCH
   and runs as <SYSTEM>SYSWAT.

 WTCHIO.MAC
   Utility routines for WATCH.F4.



   <RINDFLEISCH>
   =============

 DTPLOT.SAI => DTPLOT.SAV
   Plots data by date through OMNIGRAPH - used for report figures.

 NMPLOT.SAI => NMPLOT.SAV
   Simple program for plotting data tabulated in (x,y) pairs.



   <ACCOUNTS>
   ==========

 ACCT.MAC
   Assembly language utility routines for ACCT10.

 ACCT10.F4 => ACCT10.SAV
   Basic accounting program provided by BBN which scans FACT.<date>
   files and produces listings by account, user, etc. of CPU usage,
   connect time, and file usage.
