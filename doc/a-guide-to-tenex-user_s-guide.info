The following user programs listed in TUG are available:

	(See <DOC>A-LIST-OF-AVAILABLE-DOCUMENTS.INFO for
	 the full names of documents referenced and where
	 to order them.)

BASIC  -- Primary documentation is DEC Mathematical Languages Handbook.
          A short online summary of commands is in <DOC>BASIC.HLP.
          Alternative language is TBASIC (a TENEXized version of 
          DARTMOUTH BASIC).

BCPL   -- Documentation forthcoming.

BINCOM -- This program is not recommended.  DEC has replaced it with 
          FILCOM which is documented in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook.

BLISS  -- This is a TENEXized version of BLISS.   The TENEX updates
          are documented in <DOC>BLISS.HELP.  Also available is
          the DEC version called BLIS10 and documented in the DEC BLIS10
          manual.  This manual will be fairly useful for either version.
          The command strings for BLIS10 are summarized on-line in
          <DOC>BLIS10.HLP

CALENDAR--The doc from TUG is also available on-line in 
	  <DOC>CALENDAR.MANUAL.

CCL    -- <DOC>CCL.HELP lists the available commands.  For a description
          of each of the commands listed as available see the
          DEC User's Handbook.

COPYM  -- Documented in TUG.  This documentation is correct but not
          clear on the use of directory names.  See <DOC>COPYM.HELP
          for details.  To see what files are on a given DECTAPE after
          it is mounted use  @DIR DTAn:  where n is 0 or 1.  An 
          alternative program is FILES which is self-documenting.

CREF   -- Documented in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook with brief summary
          on <DOC>CREF.HLP.  The version currently at SUMEX is not
          the TENEX version discussed in TUG.

DDT    -- Documented in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook with TENEX updates
          in TUG.  The version at SUMEX now has single-stepping see
	  <DOC>DDT.SUPPLEMENT for details.  Other on-line summaries are
	  listed with their authors in <DOC>DDT.HELP.

DELVER -- Complete documentation is in TUG.  See also DELOLD documented
          in <DOC>DELOLD.HELP for a program which deletes files
          according to a cutoff date of last access.

DTACPY -- This program is unavailable, but DTACOP is nearly equivalent.

DUMPER -- No documentation is currently available--see an operator
          for help with tapes.

FAIL   -- For a discussion of the versions of FAIL available at 
          SUMEX see <DOC>FAIL.HELP.  The Stanford AI Lab 1970
          FAIL manual by Phil Petit (not the manual referenced by 
          TUG) is available on-line in <DOC>FAIL.MANUAL.

F40    -- (see FORTRAN below)

FORTRA -- (see FORTRAN below)

FORTRAN - The two versions of Fortran available at SUMEX are F40 which 
          is the older DEC FORTRAN IV and FORTRA which is the newer 
          DEC FORTRAN10.  F40 is documented in the DEC Mathematical
          Lang. Handbook and updates are in the FORTRAN section of 
          TUG.  FORTRA is documented in the DEC FORTRAN10 Manual. 
          (Disregard any information in TUG about the respective names
          of these versions.)  FORTRA is the newer of these two programs
          but is not yet fully debugged and is therefore not recommended
          unless some of its new features are actually needed.  F40 is
          upwards compatible so there will be no difficulty converting
          when a debugged version of FORTRA becomes available.  The
          command sequence for FORTRA is summarized in <DOC>FORTRA.HLP.
          The file <DOC>FORTRAN.HELP contains introductory information
          on running and debugging Fortran programs. Most of the
          specific information on compiling, loading, and running 
          programs is specifically for F40 but the lengthy discussion
          on using DDT with Fortran is also applicable to FORTRA as 
          well as F40.  The FORTRAN bullein board (which can be 
	  accessed by the BBD program) contains updates, bugs,
	  general info, available subroutine packages, etc.

FILCOM -- The command format and switches are listed in <DOC>FILCOM.HLP.

FILEX  -- Documented in TUG with updates and command summary on <DOC>.

FRKCOM -- Documented in TUG. [Note-the command  @GOTO 777000 in the
          example starts the FRKCOM program since 777000 is its entry
          point.)

FTP    -- Documented in TUG.

FUDGE2 -- Main documentation is in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook.

GRIPE  -- A self-documenting program.

HOSTAT -- Documented in TUG.

IDDT   -- Documented in TUG (a duplicate of this doc is available
          on-line in <DOC>IDDT.HELP).

LINK10 -- Main documentation in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook.  List
	  of switches on-line in <DOC>LINK10.HLP.

LISP   -- The documentation is the INTERLISP manual.  It can be
          accessed on-line through the help system which is called from
          LISP by  HELPSYS(argument)  which is currently implemented
          only for function definitions but will be expanded.
          <BULLETINS>LISP.BBD contains updates and news about LISP.
	  ILISP is also available and is documented in <DOC>ILISP.MANUAL.

LOADER -- This is an older DEC loading program.  DEC now supports 
          LINK10 instead.  TUG includes only brief documentation and
          then references the DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook.  In fact
          LOADER is only documented in versions of this Handbook
          dated 1972 or older.  The 1973 version documents LINK10
          but does include a brief table of the differences between
          LINK10 and LOADER (this table is also available on-line in
          <DOC>LINK10-LOADER-DIFFERENCES.HELP)  <DOC>LINK10.HLP
          contains a list of the command format and switches for LINK10.

MACRO  -- Documented in DEC Assembly Lang. Handbook with 
          updates documented in TUG. [Note-the object and source
          files should be separated by a _ (underline or backarrow)
          rather than a space as suggested in the Handbook.]
	  An alternative assembly language is FAIL.

MAILER -- This program is run automatically and is not available to
	  general users.

MAILSTAT--Documented in TUG.

MAILSYS - Documentation is <DOC>MAILSYS.MANUAL.

MTACPY  - Documented in TUG.

NETSTAT - Documented in TUG.

PA1050 -- Documented in TUG.

PCSAMP -- Documented in TUG.

READMAIL- Documented in TUG. A new option "R" is available for reverse
          order (oldest last).  If you wish to read your messages
          since the date of last reading with a minimum of fuss, type
          @READMAIL<CR><CR>.  By typing ahead the second carriage return
          the program herald is suppressed.  When dates are specified
          most common date formats can be used but the year
          must be included, i.e., 9/11/74 or Sept 11 1974.  
	  By including READMAIL<CR><CR> in your LOGIN.CMD file, you
	  can have all your recent messages printed out automatically
	  at login. An alternative program is RD which is self-
	  documenting. [Note that the help command in RD is MH<ALTMODE>.
	  The $ is often used to indicate ALTMODE or ESCAPE.]  A new 
	  improved version of RD is also available called BANANARD.  
	  There are a variety  of features offered including jumping 
	  to lower fork to edit, using SNDMSG and  returning, deleting 
	  messages from file, and reading only selected messages.  See 
	  <DOC>BANANARD.HELP.

RUNFIL -- Documented in TUG.

RUNOFF -- The version at SUMEX is the original DEC program.  The
          documentation for it which is online in <DOC>RUNOFF.MANUAL
          is nearly identical to that in TUG.  Exceptions are:
          the order of the options offered, additional options are 
          prompted by <ALTMODE> rather than comma, filenames are 
          DEC-style, and the PAGE and CENTER commands have an extra
          argument.  An alternative document preparation language is
          PUB.

SDDT   -- Documented in TUG.

SNDMSG -- The program has been significantly modified since it was 
          documented in TUG.  The file <DOC>SNDMSG.HELP includes a 
          few points to note and a typescript of the on-line help.

SNOBOL -- A copy of DECUS 10-104 by L.P.Wade entitled "SNOBOL4"
          is available on-line in <DOC>SNOBOL.MANUAL (this manual
	  is also available in hard copy.)  Also available in hard copy
	  is THE SNOBOL4 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE by Griswold,
	  Poage, and Polonsky.  SITBOL a compiler for a variant of 
	  SNOBOL is also available.

SORT   -- There is brief documentation in TUG with a reference to 
          APPENDIX E of the DEC COBOL manual.  An extract from this
          APPENDIX is available on-line in <DOC>SORT.HLP.

SPELL  -- SUMEX does not have the TENEXized version of SPELL so
	  DEC-style filenames must be used.  See <DOC>SPELL.MANUAL.

SRCCOM -- Documented in TUG (this is preferable to FILCOM for text
          and program source code files.)

SYSDPY -- Brief documentation is available on-line in <DOC>SYSDPY.HELP.
	  This display program is only available for DataMedia terminals.

TAPCNV -- Documented in TUG.

TECO   -- A TENEX TECO manual is now available (in hardcopy only).
          It contains two sections--an introductory TUTORIAL and a 
          HANDBOOK.  All older sources of documentation including both
          TUG and the DEC handbooks should be ignored.  Several
          on-line sources of doc are also available 1) <DOC>TECO.SAMPLE
          is a discussion of how to create RD which is a good example
          of writing TECO macros, 2) <DOC>TECO.COMMANDS is an on-line
          copy of the summary of commands from the new TENEX TECO
          manual, 3) <DOC>TECO.HELP1 and <DOC>TECO.HELP2 are two brief
          introductions to TECO which may be useful although the
          TUTORIAL section in the new manual is probably the best source
          for a beginner.  The primary alternative editors used at
          SUMEX are SOS for hardcopy terminals and TV
          for DATA-MEDIA displays.  POET, XED, and DED are also 
	  available.

TIPCOPY - Documented in TUG and <DOC>TIPCOPY.HELP.

TTYTRB -- Since user's terminals are at various locations around the
          country, each site will establish its own procedures
          for reporting terminal problems.  Therefore TTYTRB should
          not be used for broken terminals.  It may be used for
  	  reporting problems that are caused by the lines between
	  the terminal and the computer which need to be brought to 
	  the attention of the system staff.

TTYTST -- Documented in TUG.

TTYBIN -- Documented in TUG.

TYPREL -- Documented in TUG.

UDDT   -- Documented in TUG.

WATCH  -- Documented in TUG.
