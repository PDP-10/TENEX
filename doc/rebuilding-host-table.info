 Rebuilding the ARPANET host tables

  Geoff Goddfellow (Geof@ka) maintains the host table list for
most ARPANET sites. He sends a mesage to the liaison whenever
this list has changed. The procedure is :
 	1. telnet to SRI-KA
	2. login under the SUMEX account
	3. run FTP
	4. conn back to the host AIM
	5. FTP login under your account 
	6. send the file <SYSTEM>HOST-NAME/DESCRIPTOR-FILE.TXT (escape)
	   TO <SYSTEM>HOST-NAME/DESCRIPTOR-FILE.TXT;ASTAFF <carriage ret)
	7. quit the FTP connection
	8. logout from SRI-KA
	9. disconnect the telnet connection.
	10. quit from telnet
	11. run TDDT
	12. say $$U (unlock write protected monitor)
	13. say PUSHJ P,HSTINI$X
	14. if it returns +2, then ^C out of tddt
	15. if not, something is wrong and contact Andy Sweer
