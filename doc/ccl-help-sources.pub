.starttext
 	CCL (Concise Command Language) is a program to automatically
compile, load and possibly execute user programs.  It
simplifies communications and requires less typing as the user
need type only one command to compile, load and start a program
composed of possibly several source files.
	When CCL starts, it prints the prompt "." #.  The user
may now type one of the following commands:
.stoptext

	COMPILE		BACKSPACE
	LOAD		REWIND
	DEBUG		UNLOAD
	EXECUTE		SKIP
	CREF		CROSS

.starttext

	These commands are documented in Chapter 2 of the COMMANDS
section of the DECSYSTEM10 USERS HANDBOOK.  Chapter 1 Sec. 5 
of the COMMANDS section discusses the DEC version of
this program which is called COMPIL.  This documentation should serve
for CCL as well except that not all the commands used as examples are
available with CCL.  Also the CCL program must be started
(i.e.  @CCL ) before the . prompt appears.

	The commands work as documented in the 
DEC SYSTEM10 USERS HANDBOOK, with the following exceptions:
.stoptext

	The switch
	   
             /LOADER     implies   use LOADER
             /LINK       implies   use LINK10

.starttext continue
The default is LINK10.  Loader switches for LINK10  should be
in the form:
.stoptext
	%'SWITCH'
.starttext continue
where ' may be replaced by some other delimiting character
and SWITCH is the switch to be passed to LINK10.
	The following commands are also implemented, but serve very limited usefulness since the functions are done
better by TENEX EXEC:
.stoptext
	LIST		COPY
	DELETE		PRESERVE
	RENAME		PROTECT
	TYPE		ZERO
	LABEL

.starttext 
	The following commands are also included
but work differently than one would expect:
.stoptext

	CREATE		TECO
	DIRECTORY

.starttext 
	Create and Teco use the DEC version of TECO off of the 
directory DECSYS.  The Directory command only shows files with names less than
six characters long and extensions less than three characters and only the last
version.  The wild card character ? can be used to match any character in a file
name.  Thus, DIR P?????.* would list all files on the directory that begin with
P and meet the other requirements.  The wild card character may also be used with several of the other commands.
	Tenex directory names can be given wherever ppn's are required.  They
must be given in square brackets since angle brackets are used for protection.
For example to compile a program off of the directory MON you may issue the command:

.stoptext

	COMP [MON]TENEX


.starttext
	CCL creates files on the  user's directory of
the form ]TMPCOR[.TMP;100nnn where nnn is the current job number.  Commands are stored in this file to be used as defaults for the next 
command and as a means of passing commands to the processors.  When the job is logged-out these files should be
deleted since they are irrelevant unless the next time the user logs in, the same job number is assigned again by coincidence.
	This is a preliminary document only.  CCL should
eventually become part of the TENEX USERS MANUAL.
