			IMP Operations Guide
			====================

	This is a brief guide to the operation of the IMP.  Normally  Sumex
has no responsibility or need to know about the operation of the  IMP.  BBN
(Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.) manages the NCC (Network Control Center) for
ARPA and they are responsible for everything concerning  the  IMP  and  the
modems. They handle all maintenance and network failures and  only  require
us to grant them access to the machine room when they have to work  on  the 
equipment.

	All questions and problems should be directed to the NCC by calling
Cambridge, Mass.  COLLECT.   Use   the   machine   room   phone   and  dail
9-0-(617)661-0100. When the operator comes on the line,  tell  him(her(it))
that you are calling Boston collect and your name is Sumex-Aim. The network
operator will answer at the NCC and handle anything you need concerning the
net.

	SU-DSL is a PDP-11 and it is a Very Distant Host (#2) of  the Sumex
IMP. The data circuit between the Sumex IMP and SU-DSL does  not  belong to
the telephone company but is maintained jointly by Sumex,  SU-DSL, and SCIP
with SU-DSL primarily responsible. The modem for  this  line is in the rack
immediatly to the right  of  the  IMP,  just  underneath the IMP-10 Special
Interface  display.   This  unit  is  owned  by  SU-DSL  and  it  is  their
responsibility.  SU-DSL  does not communicate with the network continuously
and their status can be ignored  since  they  have  no vital connections to
Sumex.

 * -- Register B contains status information.  Mn  off  means  modem  n  is
      operational. Mn on means down. Hn off means Host n  is communicating.
      Hn on means Host n is not communicating with the  net.

** -- Push  to  select.   Depressed  means  displayed in  switch  register.
      The switch register lites can  be  tested  by  pushing  any  register
      select switch just  far  enough  to  unlatch  the  depressed  switch.
      BBN maintenance  people  will  take  care  of  burned  out  lamps  at
      PM time.

		Instructions to Powerdown the IMP
		---------------------------------

	First off, the IMP is designed to handle power  failures  properly.
You can pull the plug and plug it back in and the IMP will  recover.  This,
however, is not the most courteous way to manage a  network.

Shutting down
-------------
	Call NCC (Net Control Center)  at  least  15-30  minutes  prior  to
powerdown if possible. Request they software halt the IMP.
Then:
	1) Select the B register and wait  until  all  the  host  down  and
	   modem down lites are lit.
	2) select the OP  register.  The  IMP  is  halted  when  240000  is
	   displayed.
	3) You can now power off the IMP  by  pushing  the  power switch to
	   the "off" position. The IMP is now off.  The  modems  should not
	   require anything special. There  is  no  power  switch  on  them
	   anyway.

Powering up
-----------
	Call NCC and tell them that you are bringing the IMP back up.  They
may want to stay on the line until the IMP is up.
Then:
	1) Turn power switch to "on".
	2) Select SI state (middle position on  toggle  switch  immediately
	   to the left of the START switch).
	3) Check all sense switches OFF.
	4) Push MASTER CLEAR (just to the  right  of  the  register  select
	   switches).
	5) Select the P/Y  register  and  deposit  2000 in it by depressing
	   the switch  in  the bit 6 position. If you make an error depress
	   CLEAR or MASTER CLEAR and re-enter the number.
	6) Select RUN State using the same switch as step 2.
	7) Push START.
	8) Select the B register.  The  left half of the register should be 
	   lit. The lites  under  both modems (bits 1&2) and the Sumex host
	   (bit 5) should go out within 3 minutes. If not call NCC.
	9) The IMP is now up.

	Normal running mode for the IMP  is with all sense switches off and
register B selected to display  the  status  lights.  The  register  select
switch may be used while the IMP is running since  this  affects  only  the
display. All other switches should NOT be toggled  at any time. If you find
a sense switch selected call NCC FIRST. They  will  tell you to deselect it.
The sense switches are sometimes left on after PM.
	More Useful Information about IMP's and Modems
	----------------------------------------------

	The Interface Message Processor Operating Manual is  in  the  small
cabinet to the right of the Prentis modem cabinet.  There  are two sections
of interest in that book. Pages 22-23 describe the modem controls and pages
56-58 describe the procedure for starting the IMP.

	The modem is the big gray and beige box to the  left  of  the  IMP.
The covers (side panels) facing tape drives and  the  window can be removed
by pulling at the top of the panel until it snaps free. The panel  can  now
be lifted out of the bottom slot and put aside. The back of both  modems is
accessable from the window side of the box.  The  front  of  the  modems is
accessable by releasing the catch at the  top  of  the  rack  and carefully
sliding  the rack out toward the tape  drives.  DO  NOT pull it out all the
way as the cables are not long enough.

	Modem #1 is the top group of modules and modem  #2  is  the  bottom
group. The panel shown on page 22 is on the front side in the  upper  right
corner of the modem group. NOTE the small pin just to the right of the  RT1
light. This is a testpoint and the brass coverplate should NOT contact this
pin. The coverplate is removed by loosening the two screws and sliding  the
plate away.

	The IMP-modem cables plug into the back of the modems.  The  cables
are marked and the modems are marked (with Dymo lables)  to  prevent mixup.
Modem #1 goes to the TYMSHARE-TIP  and  modem  #2  goes  to  the SU-AI IMP.

	The headset and pushbuttons on the  side  of  the modem box are for
the separate voice circuits  that  go  with  the  data  circuits.  You  can
communicate to  the  similar  unit  at  the  other  modem  by  pushing  the
apropriate circuit button and pushing the SIG button. This  will  ring  the
foreign modem. You can answer the circuit by pushing  the  lighted  button.
you can  break  it by pushing the red RELEASE button. This is a fun feature
of the modem that nobody ever uses (nobody will answer). It does not affect
the data circuit.

	The modems can be crossconnected should the IMP  crash  completely.
There are jumper cables in a manila envelope  which  is  kept in the pocket
on the top system unit of the IMP. These are  ONLY  to  be  used  under the
direction of NCC and ONLY when they request  it.  In  general,  the  jumper
cable connects the modem #1 jack to the modem  #2  jack  inside  the  modem
box.

	One last point. The IMP teletype is used  for  special  maintenance
and debugging purposes only and should be TURNED OFF at  all  other  times.
