                   TCP JSYS Calling Sequences

This memo describes the TENEX and TOPS-20 JSYSs  for  using  TCP.
There  are  a number of parameters that are common to this set of
JSYSs and these are described first.

These JSYSs use a Job Connection Number or "JCN" for  connections
in  much  the  same  way  file  manipulating JSYSs use a Job File
Number or "JFN" for files.  Typically a small number, the JCN  is
a handle on a connection, and is assigned by the OPEN JSYS.

These  JSYSs  also  use  a  Connection  Block, either directly or
implicitly by reference to an  associated  JCN.   The  Connection
Block is a 3-word block of right justified data:

   Word-0:  16-bit Local Port.
   Word-1:  8-bit Foreign Network and 24-bit Foreign Host.
   Word-2:  16-bit Foreign Port.

These  JSYSs  take  flags  in  the left half of AC 1.  Not all of
these JSYSs look at all of the flags.  The flag bits are:

TCP%JS  (1B0)   RH has JCN rather than pointer to connection
                block.
TCP%WT  (1B1)   Wait for the JSYS to complete.
TCP%FS  (1B5)   ForceSync -- cause SYN to be sent (OPEN).
TCP%PS  (1B6)   Persist -- keep resending SYN packet (OPEN).
TCP%ST  (1B7)   Return statistics (STAT).
TCP%SC  (1B8)   Secure connection (OPEN, SEND).
TCP%HP  (1B9)   High priority (OPEN, SEND).
TCP%VT  (1B10)  Virtual Terminal.

The SEND and RECV JSYSs  use  data  buffers  which  have  control
blocks  and  which may be chained together to form a ring.  These
control blocks are called Data Buffer Ring  Elements.   The  Data
Buffer Ring Element format is:

   Word-0:  Flags,,unused by TCP (typically a pointer to next
             data buffer ring element)
   Word-1:  0,,Address of data buffer
   Word-2:  Word/Byte count for this buffer

   Flags:

TCP%ER  (1B0)   Error:  Buffer has an error associated with it.
        (1B1)   Local error.
        (1B2)   Permanent error.
        (37B7)  Error number.  The error numbers are listed under
                        "Error Returns".

TCP%DN  (1B12)  Done:   Cleared when TCP receives this buffer.
                        Set when TCP has finished with it.

TCP%UR  (1B15)  Urgent: Last data byte is urgent.

TCP%EL  (1B16)  EOL:    Send an end-of-letter with this buffer.
                        Or, end-of-letter received with this
                        buffer.

TCP%WM  (1B17)  WordMode: Buffer is formatted as 36-bit bytes.
                        Off if buffer has four 8-bit bytes left
                        justified per word. (Not Implemented Yet,
                        36-bit mode not supported.)

The  OPEN and SEND JSYSs take a "Retransmission Parameters" word.
This is controls the retransmission function.

The right half is the initial retransmission Interval which is to
be used.  If the right half is 0, the initial  Interval  will  be
computed based on the measured round trip time.  The left half of
the   parameters  word  has  two  9-bit  quantities,  called  the
Numerator  and  the   Denominator.    In   computing   the   next
retransmission Interval from the previous one, the TCP multiplies
the   Interval   by   the  Numerator  and  then  divides  by  the
Denominator.  The Numerator must be greater than or equal to  the
Denominator.   The  default values are 3 seconds for the interval
and 1 for both the Numerator and Denominator.

      Interval = Interval * ( Numerator / Denominator )

Common retransmission functions are:


SRI PR demo:  Numerator=1, Denominator=1, Initial Interval=3.

   3 seconds constant retransmission interval with no backoff.


BBN (vanilla):  Numerator=3, Denominator=2, Initial interval=0.

   Used in "average" conditions involving congested gateways and
   few dropped packets.  150% backoff from best guess initial
   interval.


BBN (old):  Numerator=4, Denominator=2, Initial interval=0.

   Same as above but 200% backoff.  Quickly hits the 1 minute
   maximum interval and turns into slow, constant period
   retransmission.

Error Returns

   When a JSYS does an error return (returns +1 instead  of  +2),
AC 1 contains an error code.  This code is an 8-bit number (right
justified in the 36-bit word) composed as follows:

      Bit Assignments:

         Bit 28:       Error
         Bit 29:       Local
         Bit 30:       Permanent
         Bits 31-35:   Error Number

      The error numbers are:

   0    Unknown Error
   1    Argument Error in JSYS (no access, bad JCN, no TCB, etc.)
   3    Connection Not Open.
   4    Temporarily Out of Resources (JCNs, free storage).
   5    Wild foreign host/port only allowed if listening.
   6    Connection Already Exists (or use of TCP%JS with OPEN).
   7    Connection Error or Rejected (No such TCB either here or
        there.)
   9    Transmission Timeout.
  12    Connection Closed or Closing (Closed remotely, cannot
        activate TCB).
  13    Wild local port is illegal (OPEN).
  15    Bad Buffer Argument.
  17    Bad Argument to CHANL.
  20    Funny pointer to STAT (wraps around memory, etc).
  21    Bad Transfer Size to STAT.
  29    Cannot change security level (SCSLV).
  30    Only internet fork can run TVTs (OPEN with TCP%VT).
  31    TCP Not Available (not on or initialized).

   The Error bit indicates if an error occured, for example error
number 12 might not have the Error bit set in response to a CLOSE
call.   The Local bit indicates if the situation is local to this
host or is due to the remote host.  The Permanent  Bit  indicates
if the situation is permanent, or temporary.

Close a TCP connection.

1/      TCP%JS!Flags,,JCN

        CLOSE   (JSYS 743)

Ret+1:   Failed. Error code in AC 1.
Ret+2:  Success. Connection fully closed.


   Flags:

      TCP%JS    JCNSupplied:    (Must be set)

        RH of AC 1 has a JCN.

      TCP%WT    Wait:

        Wait for close to happen in both directions.

Note  that if the wait bit is not set, the JCN will remain valid,
allowing more RECVs to be done.  ABORT may be used to release the
JCN  when  it  has  been  discovered  that  the  connection   has
terminated.

Receive a buffer of data from a TCP connection.

1/      Flags,,JCN or Pointer-to-Connection-Block
2/      0,,Pointer-to-Data-Ring

        RECV     (JSYS 741)

Read information from either the Transmission Control Block (TCB)
of the connection or from the TCP statistics area.

1/      Flags,,JCN or Pointer-to-Connection-Block
2/      -N,,Offset into TCB or Statistics area
3/      -M,,Address in user's space

        STAT    (JSYS 745)

Ret+1:   Failed. Error code in AC 1.
Ret+2:  Success. Data copied to user specified area, counts and
        pointers in 2 and 3 updated.


   Flags:

      TCP%JS    JCNSupplied:

        On if RH of AC 1 has a JCN. Off if RH has Pointer-to-
        Connection Blk.

      TCP%ST    Returns statistics:

        This flag causes words to be copied from the statistics
        area rather than a specific TCB.  Thus, the JCN is
        irrelevant.  The Source and Destination ACs are updated.
        The entries in the statistics area are defined in STG.MAC
        (TOPS-20) or STORAG.MAC (TENEX) between STAT0 and STATZZ.
        (Beware: the order/entries may be site dependent).

The TCB offset identifies  where  the  transfer  starts  and  the
Address  in  user  space  identifies the start of the destination
area.  If successful, min(M,N) words have been  transferred  from
the TCB (or statistics area) to the caller's space.

Specify PSI channels for TCP interruts.

1/      Flags,,JCN or Pointer-to-Connection-Block
2/      Six 6-bit bytes (channel numbers)

        CHANL   (JSYS 746)

Ret+1:   Failed. Error code in AC 1.
Ret+2:  Success. This fork will receive TCP PSIs.


   Flags:

      TCP%JS    JCNSupplied

        On if RH of AC 1 has a JCN. Off if RH has Pointer-to-
        Connection Blk.

Each  of  the  6-bit  bytes  may be either a channel number or 77
(octal) if no change is desired for the corresponding event.

      Bits  0- 5:   INTRP channel
      Bits  6-11:   RECV buffer done
      Bits 12-17:   SEND buffer done
      Bits 18-23:   Error
      Bits 24-29:   State change (open or close)
      Bits 30-35:   EOL acknowledged (Not implemented)

PSIs for the above may be dropped or be  VERY  tardy  on  heavily
loaded  systems.  Some defensive programming is required to guard
against these problems.  See TCPTST.MAC which checks  the  buffer
rings both when a "done" interrupt occurs and periodically.

        RH of AC 1 has a JCN.

The  local  end  of  the  connection is forgotten.  An attempt to
notify the remote end is made by sending a  RST  packet.   Should
this  not be delivered, the other end will discover its half open
connection the next time it attempts to use it.

Set the security level for a TCP connection.

1/      Flags,,JCN or Pointer-to-Connection-Block
2/      36 bit security value

        SCSLV   (JSYS 744)

Ret+1:   Failed. Error code in AC 1.
Ret+2:  Success. The security value has been associated with the
        connection.


   Flags:

      TCP%JS    JCNSupplied

        On if RH of AC 1 has a JCN. Off if RH has Pointer-to-
        Connection Blk.

The security value is not interpreted by the TCP (except  to  see
that  it  matches).   The  number  of  bits of the security value
actually used varries depending on the actual security  procedure
being  in  use.   In all cases the rightmost bits of the word are
used.
