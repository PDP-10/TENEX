                              ------------

   SPSS (TM),  Statistical  Package  for  the  Social  Sciences   is   a
comprehensive  statistical  report  generating  system supported by wide
ranging data file facilities.  Although originally conceived to  fulfill
the  statistical research requirements of social science, it has evolved
to encompass the requirements  of  physical  science,  market  research,
management reporting, etc.  The available statistical reports include:

   One-way  frequency  distributions  with  descriptive  and   aggregate
statistics for discrete, continuous, and multiple response variables

   N-way  crosstabulations  and  statistical  breakdowns  for  discrete,
continuous, and multiple response variables

   Student's t-test

   Thirteen nonparametric tests

   Bivariate Pearson, tetrachoric, Spearman, and Kendall correlations

   Scatterplots

   Partial correlation

   Multiple correlation and regression

   N-way univariate analysis of variance and covariance

   Discriminant analysis

   Guttman scaling and measures of scale reliability

   Factor analysis

   Canonical correlation

   SPSS is a proprietary product of  SPSS  Inc.   The  DECsystem-10  and
DECsystem-20  versions of SPSS are called SPSS-10/20.  They are produced
and distributed by the University of Pittsburgh  Computer  Center  under
exclusive  license  agreement  with SPSS Inc.  Both are available in 500
and 1000 variable versions.  Several features have been provided to make
time-sharing  use  of  SPSS  very convenient.  The input format has been
made freefield for easy program preperation.  And all output is in  full
upper and lower case font for easy reading.  A stand alone program which
converts SPSS system file tapes written on  IBM  systems  to  SPSS-10/20
format is also provided.

USING THIS DOCUMENT
----- ---- --------

   This document is organized into five sections and  three  appendices.
The  first  section  is  introductory  and  provides  citations of other
documentation.  The second section defines system commands necessary  to
access  SPSS on DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 computers.  The last three
sections discuss the SPSS control cards.  These sections assume  a  good
knowledge  of the McGraw-Hill manual.  They are meant to provide a handy
reference to the syntax, statistics, and options of each  control  card.
The  control card discussions provide both updates since the publication
of the McGraw-Hill manual and nuances of there implementation pecular to
the  DECsystem-10/20.   The  third  section  discusses the nonprocedural
control cards except for the file specification cards.  The introduction
to  the  third section explains the freefield control card format.  This
feature should understood by users who will use  time-sharing  terminals
to  prepare  SPSS  programs.   The  fourth  section  discusses  the file
specification  control  cards.   Since  the  preparation  to  the   file
specification  cards represents the one major difference between SPSS on
the DECsystem-10/20 and other computers it, should  be  carefully  read.
The last section discusses the procedural control cards.  The appendices
document  the  newest  procedures:    MULT RESPONSE,   NPAR TESTS,   and
RELIABILITY.

   In this document the symbol [7.0] is used to denote those features of
release  7.0  which  were added after the publication of the McGraw-Hill
manual.  They are documented here and in the SPSS  Update  manual.   The
symbol  [DEC]  is used to denote differences between the DECsystem-10/20
and IBM System/370 implementation discussed in the  McGraw-Hill  manual.
They should receive particular attention.  Symbols [7.01] and [7.02] are
used to denote those features  of  SPSS-10/20  that  have  changed  with
releases 7.01 and 7.02 and therefore represent revisions to this manual.
The symbol [8.0] is used to denote features of  SPSS  revised  or  added
with  release 8.0.  They are documented in the SPSS Update manual.  They
may not have  been  implemented  in  SPSS-10/20  by  the  time  of  this
publication.   The  file  SPSS.HLP  should  be consulted for information
appropriate to your local copy of SPSS-10/20.  The file SPSS.NWS  should
be consulted periodically for recent developments.

   In the syntax specifications of this document the phrases:   variable
list,  variable  name,  variable  label, file name, and subfile name are
shortened to:  varlist, varname, varlable,  filename,  and  subname.   A
varlist may be either a single variable or a list of variables.

   Square brackets ([]) are used  to  enclose  optional  specifications.
Braces  ({}) enclose alternative specifications.  The word or seperating
elemements within braces indicates that only one of the  alternates  may
appear.   Elipses  (...)  indicates  that  the preceeding element may be
repeated an indefinite number of times.  Upper  case  elements  must  be
entered  as  shown.  Lower case elements indicate information which must
be provided by the user.
                                                                  Page 4


                            SYSTEM COMMANDS
                            ------ --------

   Information to be processed on the DECsystem-10/20 must be stored  in
files.  The system is capable of performing many varied manipulations on
these files.  The user directs the system to apply SPSS to the  analysis
of his data through the use of system commands.

   The files of principle interest are:

          Data files containing raw data for analysis.

          SPSS command card files.

          Saved SPSS system files.

          SPSS output listings.

When using batch there are also:

          Control files containing system commands.

          Log files showing the record of batch runs.

Occasionally, the SPSS user will be concerned with the following:

          The raw output file written by WRITE CASES or WRITE FILEINFO.

          The matrix output of some SPSS statistical procedures.

          The temporary scratch files used by SPSS during the run.

   Files commonly reside on the systems disk  storage  facility.   Often
files  are  initially  prepared  on cards.  Very large data files may be
kept on magnetic tape.

   The commands that DECsystem-10 SPSS user should understand are:

          .R SPSS          ;the direct system command

          .EXECUTE         ;the COMPIL command

          $SPSS            ;the batch command

For the DECSYSTEM-20 SPSS user the corresponding commands are:

          @SPSS            ;the direct system command

          @EXECUTE (FROM)  ;the LOAD-class command

          $SPSS            ;the batch command

The SPSS user will also need to use commands to copy files, edit  files,
rename  files,  delete  files,  etc.   Commands  for  these purposes are
discussed elsewhere.
                                                                  Page 5


   Which commands the SPSS user employs and how he organizes  his  files
depends  on  what  approach  to SPSS he choses.  The choices of approach
depend  on  the  availability  of  card  punches,  line  printers,   and
terminals.

   There are three approaches to using of SPSS on DECsystem-10/20:

          Batch submitted from cards.

          Batch submitted from terminals.

          Time-sharing directly from terminals.

   Preparing  SPSS  files  using  interactive  editors  takes   greatest
advantage  of  DECsystem-10/20  time-sharing  facilities.  The freefield
control card format is designed especially for interactive  preparation.
However, batch execution of SPSS is more economical and has least impact
on system rescources.  Therefore, the best  approach  to  SPSS-10/20  is
batch  submitted  from  a terminal.  Alternatively, where card punch and
card reader are available, preparing programs  and  data  on  cards  for
batch can be convenient and economical.  A modified approach would be to
initially prepare programs and data on cards and then load them  to  the
disk  for  later  editing  and  batch  submission.   Since SPSS is not a
conversational system, direct terminal execution is recommended only for
small tasks and when other approaches are not locally available.

   As a general principle, the user should generate an SPSS system  file
as  early  in  his  research  as  practicable.   For  student  use,  the
instructor should provide a master data file, preferably an SPSS  system
file  on his disk area.  Students may then share access to a single copy
of the file.  This technique is also useful for  researchers  sharing  a
common data base.



CORE REQUIREMENTS
---- ------------

   When running  SPSS-10/20  enough  core  must  be  provided  for  four
regions:   shareable  high  segment code, nonshareable low segment code,
I/O buffers plus workspace, and SPACE for WORKSPACE plus TRANSPACE.  The
sharable  high  segment requires 15P.  The low segment code requires 40P
(42P for KA-10) region.  The 1000 variable version of  SPSS  requires  a
52P region.  Buffers and I/O work area requirements vary with the number
of I/O devices required by the program, but 4P  is  usually  sufficient.
The  SPACE  region  is  the  sum  of  WORKSPACE  plus TRANSPACE.  How to
determine the size of the  WORKSPACE  is  discussed  with  the  /SPACE:n
switch.  The minimum is 1P.  The total core required is the sum of these
regions.  Assuming 6P for SPACE, the total amount of  non-shareable  low
segment core required by an SPSS-10/20 program would be:

                                                                  Page 6


                40 P   Low segment code
                 4 P   I/O work area and buffers
                 6 P   SPACE
                ----
                50 P   Necessary low segment core

   In timesharing the user must have this amount available.  If  running
virtual,  then he should have this much physical core available to avoid
excissive page fault rates.  In batch he should specify this  amount  on
the  /CORE:n  switch of the $JOB card.  The batch user must also specify
/TIME:, /PAGES:, and /CARDS:  switches.  Time  and  page  estimates  can
only  be  made from experience.  Two minutes and 50 pages seem to handle
most student jobs.

   SPSS-10/20 may also be executed directly in  time-sharing.   In  this
case,  the  input  should  still be prepared on separate file.  The edit
switch may be used to check the program.  The output should be  directed
to  a  disk  file, then printed or typed.  The output can be TTY:, but a
lot of connect time may be wasted before finding an  error.   The  input
can  also be TTY:, but since SPSS-10/20 is not really a "conversational"
language, many typing errors will be  fatal  and  terminate  processing.
When  the source device is TTY:, then SPSS-10/20 prompts the user with a
right angle bracket  (>).   A  command  or  a  procedural  request  with
accompanying  STATISTICS  and  OPTIONS cards may then be entered in free
field format.  After the last continuation, typing  an  <ALT>  or  <ESC>
will  cause  SPSS-10/20 to execute the request immediately.  This avoids
the necessity of typing ahead in order for SPSS to verify  that  it  has
any  continuation  cards.   Warning:   The  escape  mode  facility  will
probably be removed in the future.



DIRECT EXECUTION
------ ---------

   Direct execution is the most flexible way to run SPSS.   It  is  used
when  the  SPSS program is already on the disk system.  Direct execution
may be used in control files submitted from terminals, in  control  card
decks  submitted  through  card readers or directly from a terminal.  On
DECsystem-10 SPSS may be invoked directly as follows:

          .R SPSS
          *command line

On the DECsystem-20 SPSS may be invoked directly as follows:

          @SPSS
          *command line

   After giving the direct execution command, SPSS-10/20 prompts with  a
asterisk (*) for a command line.  The command line must specify the name
of the SPSS command file  or  source.   Optionally,  it  may  explicitly
specify  a name for the output listing file or destination.  Optionally,
it may also specify switches  to  indicate  an  edit  run  and  set  the
required  SPACE.   For  the  1000 variable version, substitute SPSSM for
                                                                  Page 7


SPSS.  Note that  SPSSM  may  not  have  been  made  available  ar  your
installation.



COMMAND LINE
------- ----

   The complete command line syntax is:

          [destination=]source[,switches][;comment]

Source is a file specification as discussed in  the  file  specification
cards section.  It specifies the location of the SPSS command card file.
Dev:  defaults to DSK:, file does not default, .ext  defaults  to  .SPS,
[p,pn]  defaults  to the user's project-programmer number, and <prot> is
inappropriate.  Multiple volume files are not permitted.  Destination is
a  file  specification  indicating  where the output listing of the SPSS
program will be written.  Dev:  defaults to DSK:, file defaults  to  the
source  file  name, .ext defaults to .LST, [p,pn] defaults to the user's
project-programmer number, <prot> defaults to the installation  default.
Multiple  volume  files  are  not  permitted.   The  command line may be
continued over several lines if necessary by terminating each  continued
line  with  a  hyphen  (-).   A  semi-colon (;) may be used to precede a
comment on the last continuation of  the  command  line.   This  may  be
useful for documentation purposes.



COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
------- ---- --------

   Command line switches are used to set workspace, specify  edit  runs,
declare  an  alternate  scratch  device,  and type the installation help
message.  Earlier releases of  SPSS-10/20  had  switches  for  specifing
various  files.   These  switches  are  still  available  but  no longer
documented because of their limited usefullness.  Only enough characters
of  a  switch  need  be  typed to make the switch unique.  The following
switches are defined:

          /EDIT

   This switch is intended to replace the EDIT control card.  It has the
same effect as the EDIT control card but also sets the default WORKSPACE
to a minimal value.

          /HELP

   This switch causes a helpful message listing  these  switches  to  be
printed on the job's log device.

                file specification /SCRATCH
                                                                  Page 8


   /SCRATH follows  a  file  specification  as  discussed  in  the  file
specification  cards section.  It is used to overide the default scratch
file specification, (DSK:).  The scratch file holds observations between
statistical  procedures.   This  file  can  be  very large.  Its size in
DECsystem-10 disk blocks is:

          (number of variables + 3) * number of cases / 128

In DECSYSTEM-20 disk pages it would be:

          (number of variables + 3) * number of cases / 512

An alternate to DSK:  could be magnetic tape.  NUL:  may be used to save
writting  the  scratch  file  entirely when the following conditions are
met:  There is only one procedure request and it does  not  require  two
passes  of  the  data, such as required for factor scores and residuals;
there is no SAVE FILE request;  the subfiles are processed sequentially.

          /SPACE:  n

   /SPACE is used to set the amount of core available for TRANSPACE plus
WORKSPACE.   If  the  /SPACE:   switch does not appear, then the default
stated in the core requirements section  will  be  used.   N  N  is  the
decimal  number  of  words, that is the sum of WORKSPACE plus TRANSPACE.
The value of WORKSPACE is determined using the calculation provided with
each  individual  statistical procedure discussion, below.  If it is not
given below, then the one from the McGraw-Hill manual  should  be  used.
The size of TRANSPACE is determined by following the procedures given on
page 111 of the manual.  When using the McGraw-Hill  manual  the  result
will be in bytes that must be converted to words by dividing by four.  N
is expressed in individual words, in pages of 512 words, or in units  of
1024  words.   Pages  are  indicated  by  following the number with a P.
Units of 1024 words by following the number with a K.  If both P  and  K
are  omitted,  K  is assumed unless n is greater than 255, in which case
individual words is assumed.

   The following examples show direct execution might be used on various
batch  systems  -- either submitted as a control file from a terminal or
as a card file through a  card  reader.   A  DECsystem-10  SPRINT  batch
system file employing direct execution might look like:

          $JOB ...
          $PASSWORD ...
          $TOPS-10
          .R SPSS
          *TEST.OUT=TEST.SPS/SPACE:6P
          $EOJ

A DECSYSTEM-20 SPRINT batch system file employing direct execution might
look like:

          $JOB ...
          $PASSWORD ...
          $TOPS-20
          @SPSS
                                                                  Page 9


          *TEST.OUT=TEST.SPS/SPACE:6P
          $EOJ

A University of Pittsburgh OPRSTK batch  system  file  employing  direct
execution might look like:

          $JOB ...
          $PASSWORD ...
          .R SPSS
          *TEST.OUT=TEST.SPS/SPACE:6P
          $EOD
          $EOJ



$SPSS BATCH COMMAND
----- ----- -------

   When preparing SPSS programs for batch, the $SPSS  command  is  often
more  convenient  than  direct execution.  This command is used when the
SPSS program is maintained on cards and  and  in  batch  submitted  from
terminals  when  the command file and the SPSS control card file are the
same.  Data, if not extensive, may be placed in the  control  card  file
following  a  READ INPUT DATA  command  or on a seperate data card file.
Larger data files should be kept on disk or magnetic tape.   The  syntax
of the batch command is:

          $SPSS [(switches)]

When switches appear they must be enclosed in parenthesis  and  preceded
by  a virgule (/).  The /SCRATCH switch may not occure.  To use the 1000
variable version substitute SPSSM for SPSS.  Note  that  SPSSM  may  not
have  been  made  available  at  your installation.  A simple job with a
small number of data cards might look like.

If the data is on a seperate card file then  the  following  deck  setup
could be used:
                                                                 Page 10

If the data were already on disk then  the  INPUT MEDIUM  command  would
specify  its location and the $DATA command would be unnecessary.  After
execution, the log file generated by the batch run  should  be  examined
for  possible  run  time  errors.   This should always be done for batch
jobs.  If the run has been successful,  then  the  SPSS  output  may  be
examined.



.EXECUTE COMMAND
-------- -------

   SPSS can be invoked using the .EXECUTE command.  This can be done  in
either  time-sharing  or  batch.   The source file should have extension
.SPS.  The syntax of this command is:

          .EXECUTE command line [(switches)]

Only the /EDIT and /SPACE switches may appear in the switches field  and
they must be preceded by a virgule (/).  For example:

          .EXECUTE TEST (/EDIT)

or

          .EXECUTE LPT:=TEST (/SPACE:4P)

The 1000 variable version of SPSS can not be executed with this command.
Note  that the .EXECUTE command may not have been made available at your
installation.
                                                                 Page 11


                      NONPROCEDURAL CONTROL CARDS
                      ------------- ------- -----

   When  preparing  SPSS  programs  on  cards  it  is  best   to   start
specification  fields  and  continuations in column 16.  But in order to
facilitate program preparation on terminals the control card format  has
been  made  freefield.   Control  cards  are interpreted as follows:  if
comumn 1 contains other than a blank or tab, then all columns from 1  up
to  a  tab  or,  up  to  two  consecutive blanks or, up to column 15 are
considered to be the control  field.   The  rest  of  the  card  is  the
specification  field.   If  the  card  begins with one or more blanks or
tabs, then the card is a continuation card and all characters  are  part
of a specification field.  The specification field of a card may contain
no more than 65 characters exclusive of leading blanks.  Any tab that is
encountered  in  the  specification field is replaced by a blank and the
specification field is printed left justified on the  destination  file.
If  the NUMBERED option is specified then the numbering field must begin
in column 73.

   When entering programs, the best procedure is  to  type  the  command
part  of  an  SPSS  command followed by a tab and then the specification
part.  Continuation cards will look best if they begin with two tabs.

   A warning on preparing files with time-sharing editors is  that  some
editors  prefix line numbers to your text.  These must be removed before
passing the files to SPSS-10/20.



ADD CASES        number of cases
--- -----

   Adds cases to the system file.  If there is a subfile structure,  the
cases are added to the last subfile.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.4.1.



ADD DATA LIST    FIXED [(records per case)] /
--- ---- ----    recnumber varlist start column [- end column]
                 [(variable type)] [varlist ...]

                 BINARY / 1 varlist

   Defines variables to be added to an existing  system  file.   Defines
each  variable's name and describes the format of the raw data as to the
type of variable (in the case of ASCII files), and  to  the  record  and
column  location of each new variable.  [DEC] This command also sets the
print formats as described under INPUT FORMAT.  [DEC]  See  restrictions
on the use of the keyword BINARY under INPUT FORMAT.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.2.2.
                                                                 Page 12


ADD SUBFILES     subname (n) [subname ...]
--- --------

   Adds cases as new subfiles to an existing system file.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.4.2.



ADD VARIABLES    varlist
--- ---------

   Names the variables to be added to a system file.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.2.



ALLOCATE         TRANSPACE = number of words
--------

   Specifies the number of [DEC] words of core storage to  be  allocated
to  TRANSPACE.  One word is equivalent to four bytes as discussed in the
McGraw-Hill Manual.  In SPSS-10/20 a given TRANSPACE allocation  results
in  20  percent  fewer  transformations  being permitted than in the IBM
version.  The default TRANSPACE is the larger of 384 words or  one-eight
of SPACE.

   Reference:  Sec.  8.7.



ASSIGN BLANKS    value
------ ------

   [DEC] Many raw input data files have been prepared with blank entries
when  information  has  not been ascertained.  This is particularly true
when no missing-value codes were specified at the coding stage.   Blanks
are normally treated by SPSS-10/20 as zeroes.  However, if variables for
which both blank and zero have been used as legitimate  codes  exist  in
the  user's  file,  and the user wishes to distinguish between them, the
blanks may be given a user specified value.   This  is  accomplished  by
placing  an  ASSIGN BLANKS  command  before the first procedure request.
The value specified on the ASSIGN BLANKS command will be  given  to  all
blank fields encountered while reading numeric data.



ASSIGN MISSING   varlist (value)
------ -------

   Assigns a  user-specified  missing  value  to  variables  created  or
modified  through  a data-modification statement when one or more of the
variables referenced in the data-modification statements is missing  and
causes that cases to be treated as missing.
                                                                 Page 13


   Reference:  Sec.  8.8.1.



COMMENT          any text
-------

   Serves to insert a comment of the user's choice in  the  control-card
deck.   This  card does not affect the functioning of the program in any
way.

   Reference:  Sec.  6.6.



COMPUTE          computed variable = arithmetic expression
-------

   COMPUTE and *COMPUTE create new variables or new values for  existing
variables  by  combining  existing  variables  according  to one or more
functions.  Only one transformation may be requested per  COMPUTE  card.
The recognized operators are:

                +                 addition
                -                 subtraction
                *                 multiplication
                /                 division
                **                exponentiation

The recognized functions are:

                ABS               Absolute value
                ATAN              Arctangent
                COS               Cosine
                EXP               Natural exponent
                LG10              Base 10 logarithm
                LN                Natural logarithm
                MOD10             Remainder of division by 10
                NORMAL (sd)       [7.0]  Normally   distributed   random
numbers with standard deviation sd, and mean 0.0.

                RND               Round to whole number
                SIN               Sin
                SQRT              Square root
                TRUNC             Truncate
                UNIFORM (n)       [7.0]  Uniformly  distributed   random
numbers in the open interval of 0.0 to n.

   Reference:  Sec. 8.2.1 McGraw-Hill manual and SPSS Update.

   Bug:  Unary plus is not recognized.

   Bug:  An expression of the form -m**n is evaluated as (-m)**n.

COUNT            varname = criterion varlist (value list) /
-----            [varname = ...]

   COUNT and *COUNT create additive indices.  They count the  number  of
times  the  specified  values  occur  for the variables on the criterion
variable list and create a new variable out of these sums.

   Reference:  Sec. 8.5 McGraw-Hill manual.



DATA LIST        FIXED [(records per case)] /
---- ----        recnumber   varlist
                 starting column [- ending column]
                 [(variable type)] [varlist] /
                 [recnumber ...]

                 BINARY / 1 varlist

   Defines each  variable  to  be  entered  into  the  system  file  and
describes the format of the raw data as to type of variable (in the case
of ASCII files), and as to the record and column location of each of the
variables.   [DEC] This command also sets the print formats as described
under INPUT FORMAT.  [DEC] See restrictions on the use  of  the  keyword
BINARY under INPUT FORMAT.

   Reference:  Sec.  4.7.



DELETE SUBFILES  subfile name list
------ --------

   Lists those subfiles which are to be deleted from  the  system  file.
The  subfiles  named  on  the DELETE SUBFILES card are not available for
processing during the run.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.5.



DELETE VARS      varlist
------ ----

   Lists those variables that are not to be saved on the system file  at
the  end  of  the  run.  All variables not named on the DELETE VARS card
will be saved when a SAVE FILE card is encountered.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.1.



                                                                 Page 15


DO REPEAT        stand-in variable name1 = {varlist or literal list} /
-- ------        [stand-in variable name2 = ...]

END REPEAT       [any comment]
--- ------

   Repeats the same transformation or set of transformations on multiple
variables  through  the  use  of a stand-in variable.  The specification
field on the END REPEAT card may contain any  comment.   [7.0]  Literals
may appear in a substitution list just as variable lists.

   Reference:  Sec. 8.9 McGraw-Hill manual and SPSS Update.



DOCUMENT         any text
--------

   Retains the text appearing on the card as  part  of  a  system  file.
This  documenting  information  may  be  retrieved  by  the  use  of the
LIST FILEINFO card.

   Reference:  Sec.  6.7.



EDIT
----

   The system inspects control  cards  for  syntax  errors  and  correct
variable  names  when  an  EDIT  card  is placed at the beginning of the
control-card deck.   The  data  are  not  accessed  and  no  statistical
calculations  are performed.  [DEC] The /EDIT command line switch is the
preferred way of specifying an edit run.

   Reference:  Chap.  13.



FINISH
------

   Terminates the processing for the run.  [DEC]  In  batch,  SPSS-10/20
returns  control to the monitor.  In timesharing it reinitialises itself
and prompts with an aserisk (*) for a new command line.  A control-z may
be  used  to  exit  to  the  monitor.   If  the  FINISH  card is missing
SPSS-10/20 will generate one.



                                                                 Page 16


GET ARCHIVE
--- -------

   [DEC] Archiving is not implemented.



IF               (logical expression) variable = arithmetic expression
--

   IF and *IF create new variables using COMPUTE functions provided  the
logical  expression is true.  Only one transformation may be entered per
IF card.  The available relational operators are:

                LT                Less than
                LE                Less than or equal
                EQ                Equal
                GE                Greater than or equal
                GT                Greater than

The available logical operators are:

                AND               And
                OR                Inclusive or
                NOT               Negation

   Reference:  Sec. 8.3 McGraw-Hill manual and SPSS Update.



INPUT FORMAT     {FIXED (format list) or FREEFIELD or BINARY}
----- ------

   [DEC] The FIXED format specification may contain the  format  control
characters:  A, E, F, G, O, T, and X.  If the format specification Iw is
mistakenly used then SPSS-10 will  convert  it  to  Fw.0.   See  FORTRAN
Programmers  Reference Manual for details of writing formats.  Variables
are  automatically  given  a   PRINT FORMAT   corresponding   to   their
INPUT FORMAT.   If  a  variable  is read with an Fw.d then it receives a
PRINT FORMAT (d).  If the variable is read with  an  Aw  format,  it  is
given  PRINT FORMAT  (A).   A  PRINT FORMAT  card may be required if the
variable is later recoded to F-type.  See RECODE.  Five  characters  may
be  contained internally in an A-type variable.  If fewer are read, they
will appear internally left-justified and blank-filled.   If  more  than
five are specified then the leftmost characters will be ignored.

   [DEC] The FREEFIELD definition has  been  changed  to  correspond  to
FOROTS's   list   directed  I/O  definition.   See  FORTRAN  Programmers
Reference Manual.  This means that each case must start on a new record.
FREEFIELD  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  N  OF CASES UNKNOWN.  A
control-Z provides the end-of-file when input is from a terminal.

   [DEC] A file read under keyword BINARY must conform to the FORTRAN-10
unformatted  binary I/O specification and may be created by a FORTRAN-10
program.  These files will be processed by SPSS-10 almost as efficiently
                                                                 Page 17


as SPSS system files.  The format list specification for BINARY files is
not implemented.  This means that each case must  occupy  precisely  one
logical  record and that no variables may be skipped on the record.  The
user may cause trailing values to be ignored by  specifying  fewer  than
the total number of variables in the record on the VARIABLE LIST card.



KEEP VARS        varlist
---- ----

   Lists those variables which are to be saved on a new or updated  SPSS
system file at the end of the run.  The variable list may utilize the TO
convention.  All variables not named on the KEEP VARS card  are  deleted
at the end of the current run.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.1.



LAG              lagged varlist = source var /
---              [lagged varlist = ...]

   [7.0] LAG and *LAG assign the value of the source  variable  for  the
previous  case  in  a  subfile  to a variable for the current case.  The
first variable named on the lagged variable  list  will  be  lagged  one
observation,  the  second  named, lagged two observations, etc.  Missing
values resulting from lagging as in the first case of a subfile or as  a
result  of the missing value on the source variable may be defined by an
ASSIGN MISSING card for the lagged variable list,  or  (by  default)  by
assigning  the first missing value or low end of the missing value range
defined for the source variable.

   Reference:  SPSS Update manual.



LIST ARCHINFO    {VARLIST or COMPLETE}
---- --------

   [DEC] Archiving is not implemented.



LIST CASES       [CASES = n /]
---- -----       VARIABLES = {varlist or ALL}

   Lists the values of selected variables for the first n  (selected  or
sampled) cases in the file (or in each subfile group).

   Reference:  Sec.  10.2.



                                                                 Page 18


LIST ERRORS
---- ------

   [DEC] Because SPSS-10/20 prints complete error messages as the errors
occur, the LIST ERRORS command is not implemented.



LIST FILEINFO    {{[VARLIST] [SORTVARS] [VARINFO] [LABELS]
---- --------    [SUBDIRECTORY] [DOCUMENTS]} or COMPLETE}

   Lists an SPSS file's data-definition information.

   Reference:  Sec.  10.1.



MERGE FILES
----- -----

   [DEC] The MERGE FILE command is not implemented.



MISSING VALUES   varlist (value list) / ...
------- ------

   Specifies the missing values for any or all of the variables  in  the
user's  file.   May also be used to define missing values for recoded or
transformed variables.  [7.0] Zero, one, two, or  three  values  may  be
specified  in  the value list.  If zero is specified then all previously
defined missing value definitions are eliminated.  Two values  may  also
be combined with the keyword THRU in order to specify a range of missing
values.  The keywords HIGHEST or HI and LOWEST or LO may  be  used  with
the THRU construction.  If a THRU construction is used, then at most one
more individual missing value may be specified.  [DEC] The keyword BLANK
is  not  permitted.   See  the  above  discussion  of the ASSIGN MISSING
control card.



N OF CASES       {number or ESTIMATED number or UNKNOWN
- -- -----

   [DEC] In SPSS-10 if the number  of  cases  is  not  known,  then  the
keyword  ESTIMATED  followed  by  a reasonable estimate of the number of
cases should be specified.  This number is used to  allocate  contiguous
blocks  of  disk storage for scratch and SAVE FILEs.  This will increase
efficiency.  The monitor message  "Exceeding  quota"  may  occur  during
execution,  indicating that the user has insufficient disk available for
his scratch or system save file if no  cases  or  variables  are  to  be
permanently deleted.
                                                                 Page 19


   Reference:  Page 40 McGraw-Hill manual.



NUMBERED
--------

   Causes columns  73  to  80  of  all  SPSS  control  cards  and  their
continuations  to  be ignored so that the user may use these columns for
sequence numbers or other identifying information.   [7.0]  The  keyword
YES is not required on the NUMBERED control card.

   Reference:  Sec.  6.8.



OPTIONS          option number list
-------

   Provides  the  subprogram  activated  by  the  procedure  card   with
information  concerning  the  desired  options,  such  as how to process
missing data.  Options are specified by the  number  in  the  individual
subprogram  write-ups.  [DEC] The inclusive TO convention may be used in
a number list on the OPTIONS card.

   Reference:  Sec.  5.2.



OSIRIS VARS      varlist
------ ----

   In  SPSS-10/20  when  reading  an  IBM System/370  OSIRIS  tape,   an
INPUT MEDIUM  card  must precede the OSIRIS VARS card.  A .SET BLOCKSIZE
(DEC-10) or @SET TAPE RECORD-LENGTH (DEC-20)  monitor  command  must  be
issued.   OSIRIS dictionary files have a block size of 1600 bytes or 400
words.  Some data files may have even larger  record  sizes.   The  tape
must  be positioned at the OSIRIS dictionary file except that tape-label
files will automatically be skipped.  This  may  be  accomplished  using
PIP.   The data file is assumed to follow the dictionary file but may be
separated from it by tape-label files.  [7.0] Missing  values  specified
on  OSIRIS  data  files  are  now treated in SPSS as they are treated in
OSIRIS;  that is, the second specified missing value is one  end  of  an
indefinite range of missing values -- the end closest to 0.0.

   Credit:  The OSIRIS file reading routine was written by Mr.  Tim Hill
of Wesleyan University.

PAGESIZE         {n or NOEJECT}
--------

   Allows the user to specify the number  of  printed  lines  per  page.
[DEC] NOEJECT is the default.

PRINT BACK       {NO or CONTROL or FORMAT}
----- ----

   Controls the printing of control cards and the format  correspondence
table.   The keyword NO suppresses the printing of control cards and the
format correspondence table.  FORMAT suppresses the printing of  control
cards   only.    CONTROL   suppresses   the   printing   of  the  format
correspondence table only.  [DEC] When the destination device  is  TTY:,
control-O  may  be  used  to  suppress the output of the header message.
Listing will automatically resume with the  first  control  card.   When
both  the  source and destination devices are TTY:  then, the PRINT BACK
default becomes FORMAT.

PRINT FORMATS    varlist ({value or A}) / ...
----- -------

   This card must follow the INPUT FORMAT card.  The above discussion of
the  INPUT  FORMAT  card  should  be consulted to understand how SPSS-10
establishes its print format defaults.

RECODE           varlist (value list = new value)
------           {(value list = new value) or (CONVERT)} / ...

   RECODE and *RECODE recode variable values.  [7.0] Adjacent values may
be  listed  implicitly with the keyword THRU.  Keywords LOWEST or LO and
HIGHEST or HI may be used instead of numeric values.  ELSE  recodes  all
values  not  otherwise assigned.  CONVERT recodes alphanumeric variables
into  numeric  variables.   When  using  the  CONVERT  procedure,  if  a
variable's  PRINT FORMAT is (A), then the variable will be automatically
given PRINT FORMAT (0).  This default may be later changed with a  PRINT
FORMATS card.  [DEC] The keyword BLANK is not recognized.  See the above
discussion of the ASSIGN BLANKS data-definition control card.

   Warning:   It  is  a  common  error  to  recode  alphanumeric  valued
variables  to  numeric  and  forget  to  provide  a proper PRINT FORMATS
command.

   Reference:  Sec. 8.1 McGraw-Hill manual.



REORDER VARS     varlist
------- ----

   Reorders the variables in a system file.  If  no  SAVE FILE  card  is
inserted, the REORDER VARS card is ignored.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.7.



RUN NAME         run label of up to 64 characters
--- ----

   Provides a header label at the top of each  page  of  printed  output
generated by the run.

   Reference:  Sec.  11.7.



RUN SUBFILES     {[(subname list) [...]] [EACH] [ALL]}
--- --------

   Instructs  the  system  how  the  user  wishes  the  subfiles  to  be
processed.   The  keyword  EACH  specifies  that  each  subfile is to be
treated independently.  ALL (default) indicates that  subfile  structure
will  be ignored.  Combinations of subfiles are formed by placing two or
more subfiles within the same set of parentheses.

   Reference:  Sec.  5.5.

SAMPLE           m
------

   SAMPLE and *SAMPLE draw a random sample of the cases  in  the  user's
file.   The  sampling  factor m must be a positive number less than 1.0.
[7.0]:  SAMPLE and *SAMPLE are now executed  in  sequence.   Previously,
they  would  be executed first in a series of data selection statements,
no matter where they occurred in the deck.  Arguments greater  than  1.0
will no longer be accepted.  Previously, arguments greater than or equal
to 1.0 were interpreted as percentages.

   Reference:  Sec. 9.1 McGraw-Hill manual and SPSS Update.



SAVE ARCHIVE
---- -------

   [DEC] Archiving is not implemented.



SEED             large positive integer or zero
----

   [DEC] The random number generator is initialized from a default seed.
Therefore,  runs  that  employ  random numbers always yield reproducible
results.  The SEED command may be used to change the default and produce
different  streams  of  random  numbers.   Its  value  should be a large
positive integer or zero.  If its value is zero then the  standard  seed
will be employed.  Multiple SEED cards may be employed to reset the seed
and create individually reproducible samples.



SELECT IF        (logical expression)
------ --

   SELECT IF and *SELECT IF select for processing only those cases which
meet  the  criteria specified in the logical expression.  [7.0] They are
executed in sequence.  If more than one SELECT IF or  *SELECT IF  appear
in  a  deck  they  are  connected  by logical AND;  that is, a case must
satisfy the conditions specified on all SELECT IF and  *SELECT IF  cards
to be selected.

STATISTICS       {statistic number list or ALL}
----------

   Provides  the  subprogram  activated  on  the  procedure  card   with
instructions  concerning  the  desired statistics to be computed for the
output.  Each subprogram has its own list of available statistics and  a
corresponding number list for their selection and activation.  [DEC] The
inclusive TO convention may be used in a number list on  the  STATISTICS
card.

   Reference:  Sec.  5.3.



SUBFILE LIST     subname (n) [subname ...]
------- ----

   Defines the subfile structure for an SPSS system file being generated
or  redefines  the  subfile  structure  of an existing SPSS system file:
subfile names of up to eight characters  must  have  unique  first  four
characters.   The  N OF CASES card is not used when SUBFILE LIST card is
included in a file-generating run.  [DEC] The subfile structure may also
be redefined using the SORT CASES command.

   Reference:  Sec.  6.2.



TASK NAME        label
---- ----

   Provides a user-supplied printed label below the run  label  on  each
page of output to identify specific or separate tasks.

   Reference:  Sec.  6.2.



VALUE LABELS     {varlist or ALL} (value) label (value) label ...  /
----- ------     varlist (value) label (value) label ...

   Associates a label of up to 20 characters with each value of  any  or
all  of  the  variables in a file.  [7.0] The keyword ALL may be used to
refer to the entire set of user defined variables.

VAR LABELS       varname, varlabel /
--- ------       [varname, ...]

   Enables the user to associate an extended variable label of up to  40
characters in length with any or all of the variables in a file.

   Reference:  Sec.  4.11.



VARIABLE LIST    varlist
-------- ----

   Provides each variable to be entered into the file with a name of  up
to  eight  characters  in  length.  All subsequent processing of data is
accomplished by reference to these variable names.

   Reference:  Secs.  4.2 and 4.6.4.



WEIGHT           varname
------

   WEIGHT and *WEIGHT weight cases based upon  the  named  variable.   A
value of 1.0 for the named variable will not effect the case and a value
of 0.0 or less will eliminate the case.  Any other value will be used to
weight the case.

                 [PRNTFMTS] [VARLABS] [VALLABS] [DOCUMENTS]} or ALL} /
                 [NUMBERED]

   Writes all data-definition information currently resident on the SPSS
system  file  in  the form of standard SPSS data-definition cards on the
RAW OUTPUT UNIT.  [DEC] The WRITE  FILEINFO  procedure  always  produces
ASCII files.  If the CHAR = construction is employed it will be ignored.

                        FILE SPECIFICATION CARDS
                        ---- ------------- -----

   The  most  significant   difference   between   the   DECsystem-10/20
implementations  of SPSS and other implementations is in the preparation
of nonprocedural cards that  specify  files.   The  logic  of  the  file
specification  cards  is the same as described in the McGraw-Hill manual
but the syntax is significantly different.

   The complete syntax of a file specification is:

                dev:filename.ext[p,pn]<prot>+vid2+...

This is the same as the DECsystem-10 file specification  syntax  without
subfile  directories  and  extended  to  support  multiple volume files.
Normally, only filename and extension need  to  be  specified.   [7.02A]
Blanks  may  not  occur  within  the  file  specification.  DECsystem-20
directory names, long file  names,  generation  numbers,  etc.  are  not
supported.

   Dev is the logical name of the device on which the file  is  located.
It  may  be from one to six alphanumeric characters, followed by a colon
(:).  In SPSS-10/20 dev  always  defaults  to  DSK.   On  the  GET FILE,
FILE NAME,  and  SAVE FILE the file name serves two purposes.  The first
one to eight alphanumeric caracters are used to form the  SPSS  internal
system  file  name.  On all file specification commands the first one to
six characters of the file name will  be  used  as  the  DECsystem-10/20
directory file name.  Ext is the extension of the file name.  SPS is the
recommended extension for  SPSS  source  program  files.   P,pn  is  the
project-programmer number of the user's directory area from which a file
should be read.  It always defaults to user's own directory.  Prot is  a
three digit octal number used to limit access to files by other users.

   To use the multiple volume syntax, the  first  magnetic  tape  volume
should be mounted on some logical device using the system mount command.
The file specification is then the logical device name terminated with a
colon  (:),  followed  by an internal SPSS file name, followed by a plus
(+), and the visual identification of the second magnetic  tape  volume,
etc.



FILE NAME        file specification [file label]
---- ----

   [DEC]  The  FILE NAME  card  takes  a  file  specification,   [7.02A]
optionally  followed by a file label.  The first eight characters of the
file name part of the file specification become the internal SPSS system
name.   The  first  six  characters  of  the  file name part of the file
specification  is  the  DECsystem-10/20  directory  name.    The   first
sixty-four  characters of the file label become the internal SPSS system
file label.  Device defaults to DSK:   and  directory  defaults  to  the
users own directory.
                                                                 Page 26


GET FILE         file specification
--- ----

   [7.02A] [DEC]  The  GET FILE  card  takes  a  standard  SPSS-10  file
specification.   The file name part of the file specification is checked
against the internal SPSS system file  name.   If  they  differ  then  a
warning  message is issued.  Dev:  defaults to DSK:.  File name defaults
to NONAME.  Extension does not default.  P,pn  defaults  to  the  user's
project-programmer   number  and  protection  is  inappropriate.   After
performing a GET FILE from a magnetic tape the position of the  tape  is
indeterminate.

   SPSS system files prepared on IBM equipment must first  be  converted
to  SPSS-10/20  format.   This  is  accomplished via the utility program
SPSIBM.  A copy of  this  program  is  available  from  the  local  SPSS
coordinator or user consultant.  To use the program the IBM tape must be
mounted on logical unit 90:.  If the tape is labeled or if the  file  to
be  converted is not the first, then the tape should be positioned using
PIP.  The program will write the converted file on logical unit 1:  with
file  name  NEWSPS.FIL.  Logical unit 1:  should be assigned to a second
magnetic tape or to DSK:.  After providing  for  the  input  and  output
files, the user should run SPSIBM.  For example:

                .MOUNT MT9:90/WL/VID:B6390
                .ASSIGN DSK:  1:
                .R SPSIBM

The program will handle up to 1000 variables.  It relies  on  the  print
formats  on  the  IBM tape being correct to determine whether to convert
variables from EBCDIC to ASCII or from floating point to floating point.
If  the  IBM  tape  is  not consistent with regard to vairable type, the
sources of SPSIBM may be modified to accomplish the conversion.



INPUT MEDIUM     {file specification or CARD}
----- ------

   [DEC] The  INPUT MEDIUM  card  takes  the  standard  SPSS-10/20  file
specification  or  the  keyword CARD.  The keywords TAPE, DISK and OTHER
are not recognized.  If they are  used  then  the  proper  specification
should  be provided with the /INPUT switch.  The default device is DSK:,
the file name and  extension  do  not  default,  the  project-programmer
number defaults to the user's, and protection is inappropriate.



RAW OUTPUT UNIT  {file specification or CARD}
--- ------ ----

   Used to direct raw output data to the file of the user's choice  with
subprograms  producing raw data.  [DEC] The RAW OUTPUT UNIT card takes a
standard SPSS-10/20 file specification but without the  multiple  volume
syntax or the keyword CARD, which causes the output device specification
to be CDP:  with file  name  the  same  as  the  source  file  name  and
                                                                 Page 27


extension .CDP.  If cards are requested the user must specify the /CARD:
switch on the $JOB card.  If RAW OUTPUT UNIT is absent then the  default
is  DSK:FOR09.DAT.   When present, the defaults are:  device defaults to
DSK:, file name defaults to the source name, and extension  defaults  to
.DAT.  If this file is later queued to the line printer and if it has no
carriage control  characters  then  it  should  be  queued  with  switch
/FILE:ASCII.

   Reference:  Sec.  5.6.



SAVE FILE        [file specification [file label]]
---- ----

   [7.02A]  [DEC]  The  SAVE FILE  card  optionally  takes  a   standard
SPSS-10/20 file specification, optionally followed by a file label.  The
file name part  of  the  file  specification  becomes  the  system  file
internal file name.  Dev:  defaults to DSK:.  The file name defaults the
SPSS system internal file  name.   Extension  does  not  default.   P,pn
defaults to the user's project programmer number and protection defaults
to the installation default.  When saving a file the scratch file device
may  not be NUL:.  [7.0] The last 200 value labels declared per variable
will be saved on a system file;  however, more than 200 value labels may
be defined for use in processing.



SAVE SCSS        file specification
---- ----

   [7.02A] [DEC]  The  SAVE SCSS  card  writes  the  data  and  variable
information  to  the  file specified in the format required by SCSS, the
conversational SPSS  system.   The  file  specification  is  a  standard
SPSS-10/20  file  specification  except  that  the  multiple volume tape
syntax is not recognized.  SAVE SCSS is used like the SAVE FILE card but
may  not  be used in conjunction with a SAVE FILE, or REORDER VARS card.
Alphanumeric variables will not be saved.
                                                                 Page 28

   Limitation 2:  [7.0] BREAKDOWN in general mode requires the following
amount of core storage space:

          WORKSPACE = (NCELLS + 1) * (MAXDIMS + 7)

              where

          WORKSPACE = core storage space required in words.
             NCELLS = total  number  of  cells  in  all  of  the  tables
                      requested  in  the  TABLES=  list, where a cell is
                      defined as a unique combination of the  values  of
                      the independent or control variables.
            MAXDIMS = maximum  number  of  dimensions  in  any  of   the
                      requested tables, i.e., the maximum number of uses
                      of the keyword BY in any of the tables lists.

BREAKDOWN in integer mode requires the following amount of SPACE:

          WORKSPACE = 5 * NCELLS + 5 * MAXLABS

                where

          WORKSPACE = core storage required in words.
             NCELLS = total number of cells  in  all  tables  requested.
                      The number of cells in a given table is calculated
                      by multiplying together the  permitted  number  of
                      values  for  each  of the independent variables as
                      specified  in  the  VARIABLES=  list.   NCELLS  is
                      simply  the  sum of the sum of the number of cells
                      in each table.
            MAXLABS = maximum number of value labels for any table.   If
                      the  workspace  is too small to accomodate all the
                      labels, the excess labels will not appear  on  the

   Sometimes the researcher may be confronted with a situation in  which
his  data  base does not fit the model he has specified.  In such cases,
he may be able to use subroutine FABRICATE  to  extricate  himself  from
this   dilemma.    Subroutine   FABRICATE   allows  the  researcher  the
opportunity of generating any or all of the  variables  to  be  used  in
subsequent  analysis.   An option available with subroutine FABRICATE is
ADJUST, in which existing variables may  be  manipulated  at  random  to
increase  or  decrease  the  correlation with other variables.  Users of
subroutine FABRICATE will get error number 1, 'A control card  has  been
read  with  an unrecognized command field' and will be reported to their
advisor or grant funding agency.

   Performs simple  or  multiple  regression  with  a  stepwise  option,
produces  residuals as raw output files, provides plot of residuals, and
produces statistics associated with regression analysis.  It can  handle
forward  (stepwise)  inclusion.   It cannot handle backward elimination,
stepwise solution, or combinatorial solution.  [7.0]  If  the  inclusion
level  is  not  provided  then  level  1 (included last and stepwise) is
assumed.

   Option 14:  Suppresses axes on plots.
   Option 15:  Output means and standard deviations.
   Option 16:  [DEC] Regression through the origin.  Option 16 is useful
in  two  ways.   First,  the  SPSS  procedure  REGRESSION can be used to
estimate  parameters  and  test  hypotheses  for  models  with  a  fixed
intercept  of  zero  rather  than  an estimated intercept.  Second, more
flexibility in using dummy variables is available to the user via option
16.  For example, without option 16, if two qroups of observations exist
and are represented by the dummy variables (1, 0) and (0, 1),  only  one
of  the  dummy  variables  may  be  entered into the equation.  By using
option 16, the user may enter both dummy variables into the equation.

   In effect, option 16 forces subprogram REGRESSION to do its computing
using the uncorrected sums of squares matrix rather than the correlation
matrix.  Consequently, some statistics printed by the  program  are  not
particularly  meaningful  when  option  16  is  invoked.  The purpose of
option 16 is to permit the user to obtain regression and  residual  sums
of  squares  and  mean squares as well as parameter estimates (slopes of
b's) for a particular class of models.

   Option 17:  [DEC] Forces computation of Statistic 8 after every  step
regardless  of  how many variables are entered into the equation in that
step.

   Statistic 1:  Printout of the correlation matrices.

standardized Y' values with residuals on the vertical axis.

only after 2 or more variables are added to  an  equation  in  one  step
unless option 17 is specified.

   [7.0]  Subprogram  RELIABILITY  provides  a  means   for   evaluating
multiple-item   additive   scales  through  the  computation  of  widely
recognized coefficients of reliability. In  addition,  the  program  can
provide  the  user  with  basic summary statistics including item means,
standard deviations, inter-item  covariance  and  correlation  matrices,
scale  means,  item-to-scale correlations, and summary statistics of the
item means, variances,  inter-item  correlations  and  covariances.  The
program can perform a repeated measurements design analysis of variance,
a two-way factorial ANOVA with one observation per  cell,  Tukey's  test
for  additivity,  Hotelling's  T-squared  test  for equality of means in
repeated  measurements  designs,  and  Friedman's  two-way  analysis  of
variance of ranks.

SORT CASES       varlist {(A) or (D)} ...
---- -----

   Reorders the sequence of cases by sorting the cases in  ascending  or
descending  order  according  to  the  values  of the variable or set of
variables. [DEC] Sorting is a procedure which may  be  executed  at  any
point  in  the run with the restriction that SORT CASES must be preceded
by a GET FILE or a READ INPUT DATA card.

   Reference: Sec. 11.8.

   Option 20: [DEC] Use the values of the first  sort  key  variable  to
define  a  new subfile structure. If the first sort key has print format
(A) then the subfile names will be the character S  followed  the  ASCII
                                                                 Page 44


values  with embedded blanks removed. Thus a variable SEX with values M,
F, and blank would produce subfiles SM, SF, and S. For numeric variables
the  names are generated by multiplying the values by 10.0 raised to the
power of the variable's print format and prefixed by leading  zeros  and
'S'.  If the value is negative then the prefix will be 'M' instead. Thus
a sort key variable with  print  format  (2)  for  the  value  pi  would
generate  subfile  S0000314.  These names may be redefined in subsequent
runs using the SUBFILE LIST command.

   Limitation: WORKSPACE = (number of sort keys + 1) * number of cases



TETRACHORIC      VARIABLES = varlist (min, max) /
-----------      CORRELATIONS = varlist WITH varlist /
                 varlist WITH varlist / ...

   [DEC] TETRACHORIC is an  SPSS  procedure  that  computes  tetrachoric
correlation coefficients between dichotomous variables.

   The use of tetrachoric correlation coefficients  is  appropriate  for
variables  that  have only two observed values, but which may be assumed
to be continuous and normally distributed. When  these  assumptions  are
met,  tetrachoric  R will be numerically equivalent to Pearson R and may
be considered an approximation to it. Tetrachoric R is  widely  used  in
test  scoring  and  item analysis to estimate the Pearson product-moment
correlation between dichotomous items when continuity, and  not  a  true
dichotomy, is a logical assumption.

   Tetrachoric coefficients can  only  be  computed  for  data  that  is
numeric  and dichotomous. If a variable has been defined as alphanumeric
or has more than two values, it should be recoded  with  the  RECODE  or
*RECODE  card  prior  to  requesting the TETRACHORIC procedure. For each
correlation requested,  TETRACHORIC  first  computes  a  2  X  2  table.
Tetrachoric R is then computed from the proportion of cases falling into
the various subcells of the table.

   Two types of information must be specified on the  TETRACHORIC  card.
After  the  VARIABLES  =  keyword,  all  variables for which tetrachoric
correlations will be requested must be named, followed by the two values
of each variable or variable list. Following the CORRELATIONS = keyword,
the variables for which correlation coefficients are desired  should  be
entered. The "var TO var" convention may be used in naming variables and
refers to the order of the variables in the VARIABLES = list.  Like  the
PEARSON CORR procedure, the keyword WITH indicates that a coefficient is
to be computed for each variable named preceding the  WITH  paired  with
each variable named following the WITH. Whenever the keyword WITH is not
used to separate variables being correlated, the  program  computes  all
possible  non-redundant  correlations  from  the  variables in the list.
Multiple correlation lists may be requested on a single TETRACHORIC card
as  long  as each list is separated from the next by a virgule (/); only
one CORRELATIONS = keyword is permitted.
                                                                 Page 45

   Statistic 1:  Causes  the  mean,  standard  deviation,  and  relative
frequency  distribution  of  each variable referenced in the correlation
lists to be computed and printed.

   Option 1: Inclusion of missing data. All cases will  be  included  in
the  analysis  regardless  of  any  missing  data  values that have been
defined.

   Option 2: Listwise deletion of missing data. A case will  be  omitted
from   the  calculation  of  all  coefficients  requested  in  a  single
correlation list if the case has missing data for any  variable  in  the
list.  The  default is pairwise deletion of missing data (a case will be
omitted from the computation of a given  coefficient  if  the  value  of
either of the two variables being correlated is missing).

   Option 3: Two-tailed test of statistical  significance.  This  option
causes  a  two-tailed  test  of  significance  to  be  computed for each
correlation rather than the default one-tailed test.

   Option 4: Write correlation matrix on RAW OUTPUT  UNIT.  This  option
causes a matrix of coefficients to be written on RAW OUTPUT UNIT for all
lists that are specified in matrix form (i.e., the keyword WITH must not
be  used).  All  matrices  are  output  as  card images with a format of
8F10.7. Each row of the matrix  starts  on  a  new  card,  and  the  row
continues onto as many cards as required.

   Option 5: Square matrix print format.

   Option 6: Write means and  standard  deviations  on  RAW OUTPUT UNIT.
This  option  may  only be selected when Option 4 has been requested and
causes means and standard deviations to be written  on  RAW OUTPUT UNIT,
preceding   each   correlation  matrix.  For  each  list  following  the
CORRELATIONS = keyword, the means for all  variables  appearing  in  the
list  are  written, followed by the standard deviation for all variables
in the list. Both means and standard deviations are  written  in  8F10.4
format.

   Option 7: Print subcell  proportions  and  subcell  frequencies  from
which tetrachoric coefficients are computed.

   Limitation 1: A  maximum  of  500  variables  may  be  named  in  the
VARIABLES  =  list.  When  the "var TO var" convention is employed, each
implied variable counts as 1 toward this total.

   Limitation 2: A maximum of 40 individual lists and 500 variable names
may appear following the CORRELATIONS = keyword.

   Limitation  3:  The  maximum  number  of  coefficients  that  can  be
requested  on  a single TETRACHORIC card (and its continuations) varies,
depending on whether Statistic  1  has  been  selected.  The  amount  of
WORKSPACE required for TETRACHORIC is:
                                                                 Page 46


                SPACE = (NCORE * 4) + (MEANS * NVARS * 3)

                NCORE = the total number of correlations requested.
                MEANS = 1 if Statistic 1 has been selected, else 0.
                NVARS = number of variables mentioned in the
                CORRELATIONS = list.

   Computes Student's t and probability levels for independent or paired
samples.

   Reference: Sec. 17.2.

   Option 1: Inclusion of missing data.
   Option 2: Listwise deletion of missing data.
   Option 3: Suppress printing of variable labels.
   Option 20: [DEC] This option, when used  with  the  PAIRS =  variable
list  WITH  variable  list construction, causes the first element of the
first variable list to be paired with the first element  of  the  second
variable  list,  the  second  element  with the second, etc., instead of
forming all pairings of the first list elements  with  the  second  list
elements.
