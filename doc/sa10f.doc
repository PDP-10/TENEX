SA10 Documentation and Diagnostics

The following information documents notes about the SA-10 configuration,
installation, and diagnostics.

1)  SA-10 Configuration

	I/O bus device address	274
	SA-10 base address	160
	Channel 0 - disks (0C0, 0C1, 0C2, 0C3)
	Channel 1 - tapes (1E0, 1E1)

2)  SA10F Diagnostic Routines (DDT starts at location 4000)

     a)	BEG$G  - Perform static test of SA-10 interfacing to memory
	and the CPU.  Data switches must be all 0 for this test - other
	switch control settings do not work.

     b)	CMT$G  - Test SA-10 ability to access memory.  This diagnostic
	can access all 512K of memory and will exercise any range of
	addresses from 1 location to all of memory above the diagnostic
	itself.  The diagnostic does not relocate itself.  Encountered
	errors are printed out including the memory contents and what
	the SA10 saw.

	On entry the on-line memory is measured and starting and ending
	addresses for the test are prompted.  These may be defaulted to
	the lowest and highest by typing <esc>.  Random or fixed data
	patterns can also be requested.  The QUIET switch (normally 0)
	can be set from DDT to -1 to suppress error print out and to
	loop on memory errors.  QUIET is reset to 0 at each DDT entry
	(start at loc 4000).

     c)	DSKT$G   - Exercise disk read/write using random data and random
			disk and core addresses.
       	DSKTV$G  - Verify disk surfaces (writes and verifies data
			patterns systematically).

	For both of these diagnostics the on-line disk drives are
	scanned initially for read/write status.  If a drive is READ
	ONLY, its entire surface is read enabled.  If a drive is WRITE
	ENABLED, a choice is given between write enabling the entire
	surface or only the maintenance cylinders.

	If a drive is READ ONLY or comes ON LINE while the diagnostic is
	running, it can never be write enabled without restarting the
	diagnostic.

	I/O error status and sense information is printed out and up to
	8 retries of data check errors are attempted before moving on.

	If the disk controller is moved to another channel or if the
	controller address is changed, the diagnostic can be run after
	changing the variables:

	DCHANA = disk channel (normally 0)
	IDEVA  = disk controller address (normally 300)

     d)	FMT$G  - Formats a disk pack in TENEX-compatible manner.  The
	logical drive number to be formatted is requested from the
	operator on start-up.

     e)	QTT$G  - Exercise tape drives one at a time.  The drive number
	to be tested is requested from the operator on start-up.

	If the tape controller is moved to another channel or if the
	controller address is changed, the diagnostic can be run after
	changing the variables:

	TCHANA = tape channel (normally 1)
	TDEV   = tape controller address (normally 340)


3)  Seldom Used or Irrelevant Diagnostics

     a)	STLOP$G  - Scope loop to request SA-10 to store fake status
	information from channel 0 and display it in AC's 2 and 3.

     b) BAFGO$G  - Checks pack surfaces, writes or updates "BAT" blocks
	and optionally formats the disk packs.  Will use up to 4
	data patterns.

     c) PTST$G  - Test routine for SA-10 printer channel.

     d) WRAPn$G  - Wrap around test for channel "n".  Special jumper
	cable must be installed between "Bus-in" and "Bus-out" of
	channel "n".

     e) MCBEG$G  - Routine to load microcode into SA-10.

3)  Diagnostic Parameters

The parameters that control the diagnostic assembly and operation are
contained on the first few pages of the program source file.  These
include:

	KIFLG=1	   We run on a KI10
	SA0=274	   I/O bus address
	CNOB=1  \
	CV=1	 |  SA10-C model
	EADR=1  /
	NCHN=2	   Number of SA10 channels
	BASE=160   Base address for status blocks
	DCHAN=0	   Disk channel
	IDEV=300   Disk controller address (0C0)
	NPACKS=4   Number of disk packs on line
	NCYL=815.  Total number of disk cylinders
	NUCYL=808. Number of cylinders accessible to users
	NSCYL=809. Number of cylinder used by system (NUCYL + 1 cylinder
			of spare tracks)
	NSURF=19.  Number of tracks (heads) per cylinder
	NRPT=5	   Number of records per track
	RECL=1000  Number of words per record
	
	TCHAN=1	   Tape channel
	TUNIT=340  Tape controller address (1E0)
	NTAPES=2   Number of tape drives


4)  Diagnostic Assembly

The diagnostic is assembled straightforwardly and should be linked with
SAEDDT.  It should be started once to initialize internal control
variables and the symbol table name should be initialized in DDT.

	 DDT
	 SA10$:
	 ^Z
	 @SAVE ... SA10F.SAV
