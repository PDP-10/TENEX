	NAME		MEANING


	SYSGO		Reload system off disk or dectape and start

	SYSGO1		Start system

	SYSRST		Restart system
		
			The following entry points may ONLY be entered
			BEFORE any initial SYSGO1 is performed

	SYSBT		Enter initial startup dialog

	SYSBTW		Set up for TENEX with EDDT and start

	SYSBTN		Set up for TENEX without EDDT and start

	SYSBTD		Set up for TENEX in DEBUG mode and start


III. EDDT switches

	NAME		CONTENT		MEANING

	DBUGSW		0		Operator not present, do not halt on BUGCHKs,
					  reload system on BUGHLTs, flush EDDT upon startup

			1		Operator present, halt on BUGCHKs and BUGHLTs.

			2		Debugging, halt on BUGCHKs and BUGHLTs,
					  write enable swapable monitor, don't run CHECKDSK,
					  do not allow anyone else on

	DCHKSW		0		Do not halt on BUGCHKs 
			-1		Halt on BUGCHKs 

	DUMPSW		0		Do not dump core on BUGHLTs
			-1		Dump core on BUGHLTs

	ENTFLG		0		Do not allow logins
			-1		Allow logins
			#		Allow only line # to login

	NETON		0		Turn ARPANET off
			-1		Turn ARPNET on

	IMPDRQ		0		No action
			-1		Reset ARPANET internal tables
					  (breaks ARPANET connections)

	TYMENT		0		Allow TYMNET connections only if ENTFLG is -1
			1		Always allow TYMNET connections
					  (logins are still controlled by ENTFLG)
			-1		Only allow SUMEXMAINT TYMNET connections

	CLRDIR		0		No action
			-1		Clears any locked directories upon SYSGO1,
					  prevents CHECKDSK from hanging.
					 (Because of bug, CLRDIR must presently be set
					  by setting a breakpoint at EXEC0+7 and then
					  SYSGO1$G.  When the breakpoint occurs, set
					  CLRDIR, clear the breakpoint and $Proceed.)

	DRUMP		0		Swap from disk
			1		Swap from drum (after changing, MUST SYSGO1)

	DRMOV				Drum migration switch

	DRIVTB + #			Disk drive/pack correspondence table.
