Introduction to the PDP-10 Computer with TENEX      Page   1



This  is  a  brief  introduction  to  some  of  the   terminology
associated  with  our  computer,  and  is  especially directed to
complete novices as well as more experienced users.

Some definitions:

"System", "machine": usually refers to the  whole  picture  above
     plus  its "software", as in "The system is up." Our computer
     is a PDP-10 made by DEC - Digital Equipment Corporation.

"hardware", "software": the hardware  is  the  actual  electronic
     equipment itself, roughly sketched in the picture above.  By
     itself, the hardware does very little, and "software" is the
     term usually given to the "system programs" which come along
     with the hardware to make the machine usable.

"CPU": Central Processing Unit  -  it  follows  the  instructions
     (programs)  given  to  it  by  the programmer - it "runs the
     program".

"Core Memory": this is where programs  are  held  while  the  CPU
     "executes" them.  "Data" from the terminals (characters) and
     from the disk (files) is also stored "in core" while  it  is
     being  worked  on.   Core memory is made of "bits" (each bit
     represents only a "one" or a "zero"); 36 bits make a "word";
     512 words make a "page".  Our core memory has 512 pages.

"Disk": programs and data are stored as "files on disk.   Program
     files" may be brought into core to be run.  "Data files" may
     be  created  and  changed  (by  text  editor  programs   for
     example),  may  be  "copied"  to  the terminal, to the "line
     printer", duplicated on disk, etc.

          The disk is where your work is kept between sessions of
     terminal  use.   Each  user may have many files on the disk,
     and the names of the files are kept in a  "directory"  named
     after the user.

"TENEX": TENEX is the "timesharing operating system" program that
     supervises   everything  happening  on  the  computer.   Our
     computer can run only one program at a time, and  the  first
     program  run when the machine is started up is the operating
     system called TENEX.  TENEX  "timeshares"  the  computer  by
     giving  control  to  a  "user" program for a short period of
     time and then taking control back to give to  someone  else.
     The  TENEX  operating  system also manages where files go on
     disk, where  programs  are  in  core,  reading  and  writing
     characters on terminals and the line printer, etc.

          Using the  PDP-10  with  TENEX  takes  the  form  of  a
     "dialogue":  the  user types a command, the system does what
     it is told including filling in  parts  of  the  command  it
     knows  about,  and  then  comes  back  for more.  The system
     program that talks with the user is called the  "EXEC",  and
     the EXEC is the program started by TENEX as soon as the user
     starts on the terminal.

          The user alerts TENEX and requests  to  talk  with  the
     EXEC  by  typing  "control-C"  (the  "control" key is like a
     shift key on the left side of the terminal keyboard  -  hold
     it  down  and type "C").  When the EXEC is ready to accept a
     command it types an "at sign" (@) - the user then types  her
     command.

"Subsystems": One type of command is the name of a subsystem.   A
     subsystem  is  a program any programmer may write, but it is
     one of general enough interest that several people  want  to
     use  it.   The  subsystem  programs  are  kept  in a special
     directory of files on the disk from which any user may start
     them  just  by typing their names.  Subsystems are the tools
     developed by computer users to help all users get their work
     done,   and  eventually  you  will  become  proficient  with
     several.
