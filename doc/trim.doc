TRIM IS A NEW EPHEMERAL SUBSYS THAT WILL TAKE YOUR CONNECTED DIRECTORY
AND IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 VERSIONS OF A FILE IT WILL SAVE THE OLDEST
AND NEWEST AND DELETE ALL THE INBETWEEN ONES.  IT PRINTS OUT THE NAMES
OF THE DELETED FILES AS IT GOES.  IT DOES NOT DO AN EXPUNGE.  TRIM WILL
ASK YOU FOR FILE NAMES =   . IF YOU SAY CARRIAGE RETURN IT WILL GO 
THROUGH THE WHOLE DIRECTORY TRIMMING EACH FILE.  YOU CAN
GIVE IT JUST THE NAMES OF SPECIFIC FILES AND IT WILL ONLY TOUCH THEM.
HOPEFULLY THIS LITTLE SUBSYS WILL ASSIST YOU IN KEEPING FEWER FILES.
IF YOU TYPE TWO CR'S REAL FAST AFTER 'TRIM' YOU WON'T BE ASKED FOR 
FILE NAMES.  IT WILL ASSUME ALL.
