  	STARTING UP SYSMON


	SYSMON can be started in two ways:

	@SYSMON <cr>

	    or

	@SYSMON <space>


	The first will begin the display with the default interval 
rate (see page 4), while the latter will first ask you to input the
interval rate yourself.  

	All commands in SYSMON (except for "?") are entered either 
with the EDIT key depressed, or preceded by an altmode.  Wherever a  
command is referenced, the "$" will stand for the <ALT MODE>, <ESC>,
and <ENTER> keys, and the brackets will represent what is typed with
the EDIT key depressed.


	WHAT THE DISPLAY LOOKS LIKE

	The SYSMON display is divided generally into 3 parts:  

		1) Job list
		2) CPU data 
		3) Peripheral data

	Basically, the job list consists of:  job number, terminal 
line, user name, subsystem, # of forks, and fork size.  Along with
these basics is a percentage relating to the job's activity over the
last minute, last 5, and last 15.  The list is ordered by one of    
these percentages, and can be changed by the [P] command (see page 3).
Also, you may instead watch an "idle list", i.e., the list of idle
jobs on the system, by using the [I] command (see page 3).  
	Both the CPU and Peripheral data is explained in the document-
ation file for the system data collector, DATSYS.  

	At the top left and at the lower left of the screen are the
numbers 1, 5, and 15.  All CPU data are shown in three columns, the
first being the count for the last minute, and the second being the
average for the last 5 minutes, ect.  The peripheral data is shown in
three lines, with the same format as the CPU data.  The double arrow
right below the     01   05    15    points to which percentage list
you are watching.
                                 Page 3

	REGULATING WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE

	Below is a list of commands that alter the display, followed
by an explaination for each.


	[N], $N

	This command will refresh the screen in case of a line error
or accidental pressing of the ERASE SCREEN key.

	
	[P], $P

	This command re-orders the job list by the new percentage (1,
5, 15) you give it.  If you use this command while watching the idle
job list, you will be switched back to the active job list after giv-
ing the percentage you want to watch.


	[I], $I

	This command toggles the "idle list" flag.  If you are toggling
the job list from idle to active, you will still see the active job
percentage list you were watching previously.

	
	[W]<n>$, $W<n>$

	This command is for windowing the job list up or down, in
the case of a list that is more than 15 jobs long.  The <n> is the
number of jobs to window, which can be negative or positive, and 
is always followed by the [W] or $W, and ended with an $ or <CR>.

	
	[+], $+
	[-], $-

	These two commands are quite similar; the [+] windows the
job list to the bottom, leaving the bottom 15 jobs on the screen,     
while the [-] windows the job list to the top, leaving the top 15
jobs on the screen.

	CONTROLLING DISPLAY-UPDATE DELAY


	In DATSYS, the data collector for SYSMON, the job data is
updating approximately every 10 seconds, while the CPU and peripheral
data is updated approximately every 60 seconds.  Normally upon entering
the program, unless you typed <SPACE> instead of <CR> after "sysmon",
a delay of approximately 10 seconds will be given between updating.  If
you wish you can change this interval by using the [U] command, which
asks for a new delay interval.  For example, if you wanted to only have
the display updated roughly every minute, you would type 5, which is
50 + roughly 10 seconds between updating.  Although the display can be
inactive for a long period of time if you set the delay interval to
something like 5 minutes, SYSMON will still accept any commands immed-
iately without delay.


	OBSERVING DATA SUMMARIES


	The command [S] will show the data summaries collected over
the span of your being in SYSMON (soon SYSMON will be able to show
a long-span summary without the hassle of running SYSMON for a long
period of time).  The display shows:


		1) Your connect time

		2) Your runtime for the SYSMON fork.

		3) The percentage of the CPU you have taken in SYSMON
		   thus far.

		4) The low, high, and current count of:

		        a.  Active jobs (if you are watching the idle
					 job list, the current count of
					 active jobs will be replaced
					 by "[IDLE]")

			b.  Idle jobs
			c.  Total jobs
			d.  Detached

		5) 1-minute load-average statistics; the low, high,
		   and current 1 minute load-averages along with the
		   time and date of each.

	The data summary can also be obtained with the [F] command
upon exiting SYSMON (see page 5).

	EXITING THE PROGRAM

	
	Two commands, along with ^C (ctrl-c), are available to exit
SYSMON.  To avoid messups with the display, ^C has been enabled and
if the display is in the middle of any kind of output it will be fin-
ished before the ^C in honored.  If you wish not to see the data 
summary (see page 4), use ^Z to leave the program, which will go to
the bottom of the screen and exit.  The command [F] will first show
the data summary before exiting.


	COMMAND SUMMARY 


	This list can also be obtained by typing "?" to SYSMON.

	[P], $P				Set percentage list to watch.
	[U], $U				Set # of 10 sec. intervals per
					update.
