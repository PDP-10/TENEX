	  DESCRIPTION OF FILES AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR
		         TTY LINE DEFINITIONS

This is a brief guide for maintaining the system information files
about TTY line locations, assignments, default settings, etc.  There are
three files involved, all on <SYSTEM>:

   TTY.TYPE	      This file tells the system what the default
		      terminal type settings are for lines 30-100

   TTY-LINES.DC10     This file documents the DC-10 ports various phone
		      rotaries, networks, and hardlines are connected to

   TTSORT.LST	      This file provides information for FINGER relating
		      terminal number, user, physical location, nearby
		      phone number, etc.

1)  TTY.TYPE

This is a text file with one line per TTY.  It specifies default terminal
type settings for lines 30-100.  The file must not have NULLs or TABs
imbedded in it.  The format of each line is:

   <TTY #>   <TTY type>   <Default settings>   ; comment

      <TTY #>    is an octal number from 30-100

      <TTY type> is the number of one of the standard terminal types
                 defined in the system:

			0    MOD 33 teletype
			1    MOD 35 teletype
			2    MOD 37 teletype
			3    TI-733 or Execuport (Variable CR padding)
			4    Reserved
			5    Reserved
			6    Reserved
			7    ARPANET virtual terminal
			8    TI-700 (Fixed CR padding)
			9    TEC
			10   IMLAC
			11   DATAMEDIA
			12   CRT
			13   DCT500
			14   TERMINET360
			15   UNIVAC
			16   BEEHIVE

      <Default settings> is a 12 digit octal number specifying the default
                         terminal format information.  Its format
                         corresponds to the TTY format parts of the JFN
                         mode word (see page 16 of the JSYS manual).

			   Bits  4-10:  page length
			        11-17:  page width
			        24-25:  echo mode
			           26:  links
			           27:  advice
			        28-29:  terminal data mode

The following are valid entries for the TTY.TYPE file:

   30      13      006120005100    ;TC101-1        DM      (SWEER)
	{TTY 30 = Datamedia, page length = 24, page width = 80, echo
	 immediate or deferred, accept links, ASCII mode}

   41      14      020577005100    ;TB105-10       DTC
	{TTY 41 = CRT (DTC terminal doesn't need any CRLF padding), page
	 length = 66, page width = 127, echo immediate or deferred, accept
	 links, ASCII mode}

   44      0       0               ;               DISCONNECTED
	{TTY 44 is not in use}

When this file is updated, the system automatically reloads its internal
table.


2)  TTY-LINES.DC10

This is a text file describing the assignment of terminal lines on the
DC10 TTY scanner.  It is not read by the system but is a human readable
documentation of the DC10 cabling.  The file is organized by line group
(G0, G1, ..., G7) and within each group by line number (0, 1, ..., 7).
For a given group/line, the entry describes the terminal or phone line
hooked up there, where it is located, and the cable tag identification.

For example:

	G3 	0	2400 DM		  TC-101  SWEER A.   	   #01:01
		1	2400 DM  	  TC-101  HEDBERG          #02:02
		2	2400 DM		  TC-107  TUCKER           #03:03
		3	2400 DM		  TC-101  GILMURRAY	   #04:04
		4	2400 DM		  TB-105  RINDFLEISCH T.   #05:05
		5	2400 DM		  TB-105  JIRAK		   #06:06
		6	2400 DN		  TB-105  DAGEFORDE	   #07:07
		7	2400 DM		  TB-105  CMILLER  	   #08:08

A second part of this file describes the layout of the Data Access
Arrangement boxes in the bottom of the Prentice modem cabinet.


3)  TTSORT.LST

This is a text file relating a TTY number with a line description, a
telephone number near the terminal, and a "group" code that corresponds
to the general location of the terminal.  This files provides data to
the DATSYS facility and thence for the FINGER program.  The entries in
the file have the format:

   <TTY #>, <Descriptor string>, <[Optional phone #]>, <(Group code)>

Note the punctuation ",", "[", "]", "(", and ")" are important in the
format.  The entry components include:

      <TTY #>		Octal TTY number

      <Descriptor str>	A brief descriptor of the TTY line use

      <[phone #]>	A telephone number near the physical terminal
			location.  This entry is optional.

      <(Group code)>	A  "group" designator giving the general location
			of the terminal.  This must be less than 7
			characters.

For example the following are valid entries:

   10, 300 BAUD TELENET, (TELENET)
   15, 300 BAUD UCSC LEASED LINE, [(408)429-2874], (SECS)
   44, DISCONNECTED, (SPARE)

Note the group designators have to be previously known to DATSYS.  Group
names are entered or modified with the DATFIX program on <OPERATOR>.
The "G" mode allows editing group names.  Then given a valid TTSORT.LST
file, the program TTSORT on <OPERATOR> will convert the text file to a
binary file TTYLOC.TBL.   This is loaded into the  DATSYS data base by the
DATFIX program with the T option to update the TTYLOC part.
