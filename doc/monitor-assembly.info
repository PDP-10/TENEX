To assemble a new version of the monitor, do the following:

	1) Connect to <MON>, if there are any *.NEW files they should
	   be renamed to the next highest version .MAC or .SMX file 
	   (according to the name of the file).  The .NEW files contain
	   any source modifications ready to go into this assembly.
	   Note all the .NEW files for later SRCCOM's.

	2) If new files are to be added to the sources, <MON>ASSA.SMX must
	   also be changed to include them in the assembly

	3) Any changes to PARAMS.SMX or PROLOG.MAC or FILE.MAC will require
	   deleting all the .SRL files to insure that new .SRL (SUMEX's .REL
	   files) are generated.

	4) Make sure that the only VERSIO.MAC version around has the same 
	   version number as the version of the monitor to be created. 
	   Delete all VERSIO.SRL files.

	5) On a hard copy device, RUNFIL ASS10X.SMX

	6) Individual files may be assembled separately by hand by first
	   assembling _PARAMS.SMX,PROLOG (and possibly _PARAMS.SMX,FILE
	   if the file needs the FILEDE universal) and then assembling
	   XXX_PARAMS.SMX,XXX 

	7) To link the monitor, RUNFIL LODX.SMX.  (Any new files added will
	   necessitate a change to LODX.SMX.) Watch the loading process
	   carefully, if LOADER produces errors, abort immediately  with
	   a ^B to RUNFIL.  If LOADER ran ok, note the output from the
	   post-load execution, if the space between the resident variables
	   and RESMA0 is negative, it will be necessary to change RESMA0 to
	   the next higher page and RE-ASSEMBLE AND RE-LOAD.

	8) Once loading is complete, rename AMON.SMX;2 to AMON.SMX-YYY;V,
	   where YYY is a short descriptive string about this monitor version
	   and V is the version number of the monitor.  AMON.SMX;1 should be
	   deleted.

	9) To load the completed monitor onto one of the five disk version
	   areas, GET AMON.SMX-YYY;V, enter DDT, $SUMBT$G (where $SUMBT is
	   DOLLAR not ALTMODE SUMBT) to see which areas are used for what,
	   then $WRTBT$G (DOLLAR WRTBT) to write out the image.

	10) Make a DECTAPE of the new monitor by mounting and clearing a 
	    DECTAPE, GET AMON.SMX-YYY;V, SAV 20 377777 DTAn:TENEX.131 and
	    SAV 400000 577777 DTAn:TENEX.SWP, also COP MONSYMS.SUMEX-
	    AIM-TENEX;V to DTAn:MONSYM.V.  Put the DECTAPE in the current
	    version dectape slot next to the console.

	11) Once the monitor is accepted and up for general use, rename
	    MONSYMS.SUMEX-AIM-TENEX;V to <SYSTEM>MONSYMS.SUMEX-AIM-
	    TENEX;V, rename BUGTABLE.SUMEX-AIM-TENEX;V to <SYSTEM>
	    BUGTABLE.SUMEX-AIM-TENEX;V and LIST BUGSTRINGS.SUMEX-AIM-
	    TENEX;V and post it on the CPU.
 
	12) On all the files that were .NEW files for this assembly,
	    SRCCOM the two highest versions of those files to .CHANGES;2
	    of the file name, and ADDMSG the .CHANGES;2 to the .CHANGES;1
	    file with any explanatory verbage.  The .CHANGES;2 file may
	    then be deleted.

	    Monitor assembly and documentation is now complete
