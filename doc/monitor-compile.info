	Current monitor compile instructions

1. Connect to <mon>.
2. Delete *.srl;* and *.rel;*. and expunge.
2.5 Also delete amon.smx;*.
3. Copy any files you edit to filename.nn, where nn is the last
   known running version number, BEFORE editing them to maintain
   backup sources for the last known running version.
4. Connect to <sweer> and submit the batch job ssamonbuild.ctl,
   giving ssamonbuild.log as the log file, and 2400 as the cpu time.
5. Inspect the log file for problems.
5.5 Connect back to <mon>.
6. If all goes well, 2 amon.smx files will result, ;2 being the
   same as ;1 with some symbols scrunched out and other good things.
7. Get the amon.smx;2, do a memstat, and then do 2 separate saves
   onto dectape.
   SAVE 0 377777 DTA0:TENEX.nn, nn being the version number.
   SAVE 400000 577777 DTA0:TENEX.SWP.
   Also do a SSAVE 0 577 amon.nn so that accidental deleting
   of amon.smx;* won't lose the save image.
8. Then get the corresponding rlrmon.sumex-aim;nnnnnn and save
   it onto dectape as rlrmon.sav.
9. copy monsyms.sumex-aim and bugtable.sumex-aim to <system>.
10. copy loader-map.sumex-aim and bugstrings.sumex-aim to lpt:.
11. Run <mon>smons.sav giving monsyms.sumex-aim as input and
   <system>sorted-monsyms.sumex-aim as output, this is for anal.
12. To bring it up first take the system down and clear core.
13. Readin from dectape and respond TENEX.nn to TENDMP.
14. It should spin the tApe and type out EDDT on the CTY.
15. Enter the following from EDDT.
    CHKADR(BUGCHK)$7B  BUGADR(BUGHLT)$8B
   also set DBUGSW TO 1 and DCHKSW to -1.
16. Any patches to the resident portion of the monitor ( < 400000 )
    may also be entered at this time.
17. To add patches to the swappable portion set a breakpoint
   at location LOKSM3.
20. do 107$G
21. If you had set a breakpoint at LOKSM3 it should hit shortly.
    Enter any swappable monitor patches at this time. BE SURE TO
    REMOVE THE BREAKPOINT AT LOKSM3 BEFORE GOING ON. After all
    patches are in type $p to procede.
22. Heap a big sigh.
