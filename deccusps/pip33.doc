1.        Summary

PIP version 33 is version 32 with  edits  #40  through  #77.
This  version  has  no  new  deficiencies and fully replaces
version 32.

2. & 3.   Changes

#40       Device SYS did not work in small  monitor  (5.04),
          because  DEVPPN UUO does not work.  Fix is to test
          for 5 series monitor and use [1,4] if DEVPPN fails
          rather than [1,1].

#41       PIP gave a  fatal  ?  error  if  a  delete  failed
          because  file  was  not  there.   Fix  is  to give
          warning % error in  this  case  since  it  is  not
          fatal.

#42       Non-standard protection got turned off  after  the
          first  file.   This  was  a  bug  introduced  when
          setting protecion for level D enter.   Fix  is  to
          test for level D and if so skip the rename.

#43       Output project-programmer  number  was  defaulting
          over  to input side.  Fix, clear PPN on equals and
          left arrow.

#44       Resequencing a file lost the character  after  the
          sequence  number.   Bug  introduced in v32, remove
          it.

#45       File structure search logic does not work in small
          monitor  (5.04).   The is no fence so PIP does not
          believe -1 is end of F/S.  Fix is to test for both
          0 and -1.

#46       Device SYS does  not  work  correctly.   PIP  uses
          SYSSTR UUO to find SYS:, this is not correct.  Fix
          use GOBSTR UUO, this fixes both SYS: and DSK:.

#47       COPY command to DTA  causes  tape  to  rock.   Low
          segment  has  grown  so  that double buffers won't
          fit.  Fix test for this and try to expand so  that
          at least 2 buffers are used.

#50       Level C only, wild card commands do not work.  The
          UFD  device  is not inited.  Fix, if not a level D
          generic disk make sure UFD is inited.

#51       Remove WCH conditional (old PDP-6 dectape format).
          This  saves  space  and time and makes the listing
          neater.

#52       Remove DISK30 conditional (TEN30 single user  disk
          format).

#53       Command line (from TTY) storage is poor.  It gives
          a   free   cr-lf  after  72  characters  (so  does
          monitor), and has a limit of 41 words.  Fix remove
          extra  cr-lf  code.  Allow for undetermined length
          of command line by getting space from  free  core.
          This  saves  space  for  short commands and allows
          extra long ones.

#54       More of above

#55       No UFD  created  message  doesn't  give  structure
          name.  Fix add F/S after message.

#56       /A to a binary file gives ill mem ref.  PIP thinks
          binary  is  sequence  number.   Fix, remove bug so
          that  the  binary  will  be  transfered  as  ascii
          (losing  bit  35),  this  removes the ill mem ref.
          However no message is given to the user (unless he
          is  listing  the  file)  since  PIP  hxs no way of
          knowing the file is binary.

#57       Line too long message is output whenever a line is
          longer than the internal line buffer (132 chars.).
          Fix, make it happen only  on  /A  .   This  allows
          files created by TECO to be listed etc.

#60       Change the definitions of ac P from 5 to  17,  and
          CALFLG  from  17  to  5,  since most programs have
          pushdown pointer in 17.

#61       *.* is handled differently from  ??????.???,  this
          wastes space and does not allow users to enter *.*
          as an octal mask.  Fix, convert *.* to  ??????.???
          and  use  the  wild  card masking code, remove all
          special  checks  for   *.    On   output   convert
          ??????.??? back to *.*.

#63       # number is not handled  correctly,  it  is  right
          justifed  and  does  not  allow mixed # and alpha.
          Fix, use 3 bit  left  justifed  bytes,  and  allow
          mixed # and alphas.

#64       More of above.

#65       PIP loops if tape ID is specified but device  does
          not exist.  Fix, clear TAPEID flag at IOERRN.

#66       Block free message is incorrect  after  an  error.
          Fix, clear BLKSUM.

#67       Rename on DTA is not  always  correct,@it  doesn't
          check for name already exissing.  PIP does not use
          rename uuo, it reads directory and changes entries
          in it.  Fix, remove that code and do a RENAME UUO.

#70       Can not delete from more than one [ppn].   An  old
          restriction.  Fix, remove restriction.

#71       /T to a blank line changes multiple blanks,  cr-lf
          into one blank cr-lf, but then loses the lf.  Fix,
          account for extra character by IBP OPTR at PSCAN7.

#72       PIP will not assemble with REENT=0.   Fix,  remove
          multiply defined labels DERR7.

#73       PIP has extra <cr> in source file not followed  by
          <lf>.  Fix, remove them (5 occurences).

#74       File name generation for input from  non-directory
          devices  is  not  correct (bug introduced by #61).
          Fix it.

#75       Fix various bugs in SFD logic.  PIP will now read,
          write, rename, and delete files in SFD's.
          Note, PIP will not (now or ever) list  directories
          of SFD's, use DIRECT for that function.

#76       Previous fix to allow  null  files  to  be  copies
          causes  problems  with non-directory devices since
          they key on a null file to terminate a /X copy  of
          multiple  files.   Fix, allow null files only from
          DSK and DTA, and put back some of the code removed
          in version 31.

#77       /Y fails to copy a single file,  previous  changes
          in  version  31 changed action of LOOK routine but
          did not change RIMSW code.  Fix, if only one  file
          is  specified do not read UFD, just do a LOOKUP on
          required file.

4.        Deficiencies.

#1        Copying between DSK, DTA and MTA is in  binary  by
          default, unless one output file is being made from
          multiple input files, in which  case  the  default
          node  is  ascii.   a new switch is needed to force
          character by character copying.

#2        In nested indirect files it  is  not  possible  to
          return  from an indirect file and continue reading
          from a previous one.

#3        PIP has no ascii mode switch

#4        PIP inserts blank tape between PDP-8 binary  tapes
          when concatenating them.

#5        SPR-6059
          TYPE A,B,C
          Where A, and B do not exist produces PDL  OV,  ILL
          MEM REF, or other random errors.

#6        SPR 10-6364
          /X=A/A,B/B
          Does not change the mode for file B.
