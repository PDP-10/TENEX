1.0     SUMMARY

       This document describes the procedures for installing version 4
       of   the  FORTRAN-10  compiler  and  FORDDT  -  the  FORTRAN-10
       debugger.  The procedures described herein are:

               1.  Installation of the FORTRAN-10 .SHR files
               2.  Building the FORTRAN-10 compiler from sources
               3.  Building a single segment version of FORTRAN-10
               4.  Installation of FORDDT



       FORTRAN-10 and FORDDT should be installed on SYS:.

       The release is in the form of a failsafe tape  of  DSKB:[10,7].
       The following files ( or groups of files ) are included:

               1. FORTRAN-10 .SHR files
               2. FORTRAN-10 source and .REL files 
               3. FRTBLI.CTL - control file to build the compiler from
                  sources
               4. F10V2.FIL  indirect command file listing  all  files
                  required to build and load the compiler
               5. *.CMD - loader and assembly indirect control files
               6. FORDDT.MAC AND .REL
               7. FORTRA.DIR - a directory of all files on the tape
               8. .DOC and .HLP files for all software



2.0    INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF THE COMPILER

2.1    INSTALLATION OF SHR FILES

       The following files comprise the Fortran-10  compiler.   Merely
       copying  these  files  from  the  distribution  tape provides a
       working Fortran-10 compiler. The files are:

          FORTRA.SHR
          FORTRA.LOW
          FORTB.SHR
          FORTC.SHR
          FORTD.SHR
          FORTE.SHR
          FORTF.SHR
          FORTG.SHR
                                                                Page 2


2.2    BUILDING FROM BLIS-10 SOURCES

       Required software:

             BLIS10 5(124)
             SCAN 7(541)
             WILD 7(307)
             LINK 2(222)
             MACRO 47(113) 

       Running the control file FRTBLI.CTL under BATCON will build the
       compiler   from   its  sources  and  produce  the  .SHR  files.
       FRTBLI.CTL has successfully built and loaded  the  compiler  at
       the   Digital   Equipment   Corporation   -  Marlboro  computer
       facilities. This however, in no way guarantees its operation or
       support.

       It should be noted that building the Fortran-10  compiler  from
       the  sources  provided is not a trivial computational task.  It
       requires a considerable amount of computer  resources.  All  of
       the  modules  will  compile  within  70k  of user core with the
       exception  of  LEXICA.BLI  which  requires  75k.  The  complete
       execution  of  FRTBLI.CTL  required  about 2 and 1/2 hours on a
       KA10. It is advised that only installations desiring to  modify
       the compiler contemplate rebuilding it.  In addition, it should
       be noted that the  supplied  control  files  are  divided  into
       clearly  commented sections so that it can easily be determined
       which phases need to be reloaded  if  modifications  are  made.
       Therefore, installations inserting their own modifications into
       the compiler need only recompile the modules changed and reload
       the  overlays  affected without rebuilding the entire compiler.
       (Note:  when loading the programs LEFT72,  LEFTFM,  and  BUILD,
       undefined   globals   may  be  encountered.   These  should  be
       ignored.)

       NOTE that loading of FORTB/C/D/E/F/G will currently produce  an
       error  message indicating 5 undefined global symbols. These can
       be ignored.  The  problem  will  be  fixed  in  a  forthcomming
       version of LINK-10.


2.3    Loading the compiler with DDT

       If for some reason it is desired to load the compiler with DDT,
       there  are  a  series of LINK indirect files included which are
       analogous to the P??.CMD files used  in  FRTBLI.CTL.  They  are
       DP??.CMD and are used in the same fashion as the P??.CMD files.

       Since  only  break  points  in  the  low  segment   are   phase
       independent,  the standard technique to set a break point is to
       set one in FORTRA - module MAIN at SIXBOU-15 and then SAVE  the
       segment. This wil cause a break point to occur at the beginning
       of each phase of the compiler just after it  is  loaded.     At
       this  point  in time, break points can be set in the particular
       phase.

2.4    Single segment compiler

       The LINK indirect file ALL.CMD (and DALL.CMD ) is included  and
       can  be  used  to  load  a  78k  single  segment version of the
       compiler.  The single segment version is comprised of the  same
       modules  as  the multi-segment version with the exceptions that
       the ERROV?.BLI modules are not needed and  ONESEG.BLI  is  used
       instend  of  MAIN.BLI.  ONESEG  is  simply  a  copy  of  MAIN ,
       recompiled with the compilation control variable FT1SEG set  to
       1 rather than 0.  This eliminates the GETSEGs.



3.0    FORDDT

       To install FORDDT, copy FORDDT.REL from the tape.  FORDDT  will
       work on either a KA10 or KI10.

       To rebuild, simply assemble FORDDT.MAC.
