	The source code you now have in your possession is
a super-set of TENEX-135.  It has numerous enhancements
made by TYMSHARE for an F3 Foonly.

	In addition, the TCP-IP modules have numerous enhancements
made by BBN, ISI, and SRI-CSL, in addition to the work I have
done to retrofit it in to the F3 monitor.

	Each module should have an edit history at the beginning
explaining what was done to it.  I might have forgotten to
make a few entries, so it is suggested that you perform a
SRCCOM against your own TENEX sources to see what has been
changed.

	In particular, you should look closely at PARAMS.NIC,
our parameter file, and PROLOG.MAC, the universal symbol
file.  There should be no problem using your VERSIO.MAC,
assuming you start a complete monitor build from scratch.
You should also look at our INTGLB.MAC, to merge the various
global symbols.

	In addition to the TCP-IP modules, the following
modules have been modified to make TCP-IP work:

IMPDV.MAC
TTYSRV.MAC
TYMSRV.MAC	(If you have TYMNET...)
TTTVDV.MAC
SCHED.MAC
PAGEM.MAC
PISRV.MAC
FILEJS.MAC
STORAG.MAC
STENEX.MAC

	In addition, the file RPIDV.MAC contains the Raw
Packet Interface code, and is turned on by RPIN in PARAMS.
DO NOT TURN THIS FLAG ON, unless you really have an RPI,
which must be on the same channel as the IMP.  (The system
will die on start-up...)

	All other settings have been tested, and appear to
work.

	Two flags you will be interested in are INTBYP and
STATF.  If INTBYP contains 0, all traffic to yourself
will bypass the IMP, and be looped back by the monitor.
A non-zero setting will cause all local traffic to be
looped back by the IMP.  Useful for debugging.

	STATF, if 0, will not collect all of the transaction
data.  A non-zero setting will cause it to collect all
data.

	The run file LOD10X.NIC will produce our monitor
from the sources supplied.  It is assumed that all the
source code will reside in the same directory.

	The CCL file ASSMON.NIC will assemble and load
the TENEX monitor from the sources supplied, but will
not perform the post load fixup, merging the two
segments, and saving the monitor.  ASSMON.NIC is used
by LOD10X.NIC.

	There should be no problem intergrating the
TCP-IP modules with your TENEX, as the changes to the
other modules of the operating system are fairly minor.

	There are three more modules in which you might
be interested.

	TCPDBG was an attempt to assist debugging the
network code, by dumping packets to the CTY.  It doesn't
work...

	INCMP and INGLUK are fairly new modules prepared
by BBN for the TOPS20 version of TCP-IP.  They are not
compatible with the current TENEX version, and are included
here for completeness.

	Should you have any additionial questions, please
feel free to contact me.
