Abstract:
     BSYS is a subsystem for the BBN TENEX timesharing system. It 
   provides facilities for dumping, restoring and archiving user files. 
   It is also a file system utility allowing a wide variety of 
   functions for verifying, examining and fixing file system problems. 
   In philosophy it is intended as an extension of the TENEX FILESYSTEM 
   to magnetic tape storage, allowing file name recognition, 
   directories etc.

                        INTRODUCTION

The backup system (BSYS) has three main purposes:

  Protection for both the user and the system against catastrophic loss 
of data (files).

  Automatic (or manual if desired) file saving and deletion of inactive 
(not referenced ) files. In this manner, it also provides for another 
level of file storage.

  A general file system utility for verifying user directories, 
deleting extra versions, and a wide variety of useful operations on the 
file system.

                        CONVENTIONS

In writing this document, the following conventions are used:

1) Instructions about things to do are enclosed in parentheses.
   Ex: (mount dectape on unit 0)

2) When describing interactions with the system, characters typed
   by the user are capitalized,and characters typed by the system
   are lowercase.

3) Special control characters will be described with the following
   notations:

   a) <ALT> is an Altmode or Escape
   b) <CR>  is a Carriage Return
   c) <SP>  is a Space
   d) <RUBOUT> is the Rubout or Del key
   e) <^D>  is a Control D
   f) <^C>  is a Control C, etc.

4) In How-to-do-it scenarios semicolon is used to delineate
   comments as in the TENEX EXEC comment convention and PDP10 Macro

5) # - is used to signify the operator is to enter a number

                           DUMPS

General Description

     BSYS dumps provide an additional level of file storage to the 
   TENEX timesharing system. They fundamentally do a "page" copy of a 
   file group to magentic tape storage. BSYS dumps differ from 
   Mini-Dumper in that the tapes produced by BSYS have directories and 
   as such "know" where a file is on the tape and can position directly 
   to the desired file (forward or backward). The directory also allows 
   the listing of a specific tapes contents.
     Information about the last dump tape number plus the time and date 
   of the last dump is maintained in the FDB of each file in the 
   filesystem. This data is only updated for Full and Full Incremental 
   dumps. This allows you to do as many directory dumps as you like 
   without effecting any systematic dumping/retrieving process being 
   done by you local operations staff. This information should aid in 
   recovering smashed of otherwise destroyed files from dump tapes.

   **  SPECIAL NOTE  **
        You must let BSYS unload a tape before you can deselect that 
      unit. If you do not the tape will be no good!! BSYS "rewrites" 
      the directory on the front of each tape. The common Mini-dumper 
      practice of deselecting the tape unit at rewind time is 
      disasterous when using BSYS.  Due to a completion marking 
      mechanism the files would be redumped on a subsequent dump 
      (incremental) but the dumped data and time used is lost.

Dumping the entire file system

   What a Full Dump does

        The Full Dump function of BSYS copies the entire file system 
      onto magnetic tapes.  This process takes about 2 hours for 35,000 
      disk pages.

   How to do a Full Dump

      1. Mount blank tapes on tape units and be sure they have
         write rings in them!!!
      2. Logon TENEX as a user with OPERATOR(WHEEL) capabilities.
      3. Run program "BSYS" 
         @BSYS<CR>

         enter tape id: TEXT...<CR>
            ; like "FULL DUMP  SET 100"
         ; The dump should now be running....
         ; When BSYS has filled up the first tape, it rewinds
         ; that tape, writes the tape directory at the front of
         ; the tape, and instructs the operator to:
         
         enter tape unit  (mtan:) MTA#:<CR>  
            ; # - next unit number  
         "site" tape number #<CR>
            ; # - the tape number of next tape
         ; When the dump is completed (last tape rewinds),
         ; You must wait for the "*".

Dumping a User Directory(s)

   What Dump Directory does

        The Directory Dump function of BSYS copies an entire user 
      directory onto magnetic tapes.  The length of time required to do 
      this operation is a function of the system load and the total 
      number of pages in the specific user directory. At the end of 
      dumping each directory the operator is given the opportunity to 
      specify another directory.

   How to do a Dump Directory

      1. Mount blank tapes on tape units and be sure they have
         write rings in them!!!
      2. Logon TENEX as a user with OPERATOR(WHEEL) capabilities.
      3. Run program "BSYS" 
         @BSYS<CR>

         ; The dump should now be running...
         ; When BSYS has filled up the first tape, it rewinds
         ; that tape, writes the tape directory at the front of
         ; the tape, and if it needs another tape instructs the
         ; operator to:

Incremental Dumps

   What an Incremental Dump does

        The Incremental Dump function of BSYS copies all files that 
      have been written since either the last dump or since a specified 
      date and time onto magnetic tapes. 

   How to do an Incremental Dump of the entire filesystem

      1. Mount blank tapes on tape units and be sure they have
         write rings in them!!!

Continuing Dumps

   What Continue Dump does

        The Continue Dump function of BSYS will restart a Full or 
      Incemental dump that was interrupted do to any reason(crash, 
      etc.). BSYS keeps track of the last completed dump tape # 
      directory and dump id-text, allowing the operator to get the dump 
      going again by suppling a minimum of data.
        BSYS deletes the continue data upon succesfull completion of a 
      dump. If you attempt to continue a dump that was not interrupted 
      abnormally, BSYS will place you in "manual" mode. This means that 
      BSYS will ask you for all the data it requires torestart a dump 
      at a given user.

   How to Continue a Dump

      1. Mount blank tapes on tape units and be sure they have
         write rings in them!!! Be careful not to use any previously 
         completed dump tapes.
      2. Logon TENEX as a user with OPERATOR(WHEEL) capabilities.

      4. Manual mode
         ; this is caused by one of two things
            ; 1) you are not really continuing a dump
            ; 2) BSYS screwed up in writing the continue data and you 
            must now supply it. This is analogous to a normal dump 
            (full or incremental) except you have the option of which 
            directory to start dumping.

                        LOAD/RESTORE

General description

     LOAD AND RESTORE are the commands used to copy files from magnetic 
   tape storage to the active file system. LOAD is used if the desired 
   resultant file is to be a new file. That is it should retain none of 
   its original attributes except the data.(ie: creation date,archive 
   status, etc..) RESTORE is used if the file is to reappear in the 
   file system exactly as it was when it was dumped or archived. 

Load files (from magtape)

   What load does

        The load command was intended to allow copying a file group 
      from magntictape to the active file system. Due to the 
      difficiency of GTJFN and an indicated lack of need from actual 
      use of BSYS the load function allows only single file copies at 
      this time. The load function was designed to allow "*"'s in both 
      in the source and destination file names but the implimentation 
      is incomplete at this time.

Restore files (from magtape)

   What restore does

        Restore brings back one file(group) from a bsys-dumped tape, 
      and writes it on the disk with the exact characteristics of that 
      file when it was originally on-line.  i.e., the directory, name, 
      extention, version number, dates, and archive parameters are 
      exactly the same.

Restoring the entire file system

   Description

        The RESTORE command provides for restoring the entire file 
      system. The file system may be restored either from a full dump 
      set of tapes or from a combination of incremental tapes and a 
      full dump set. In the later case the facility to prevent ghosts 
      (files deleted  is provided. The only requirement is that the 
      first tape of the the most recent dump (either full or 
      incremental) be loaded first. This allows BSYS to obtain the most 
      recent copy of the file <SYSTEM>DIRECTORY;1 to check files prior 
      to restoration as to whether they where in the "last" state of 
      the file system.

Loading a Single file

   What single does

        Single also allows you to retrieve a file from a bsys-dumped 
      tape.  however, it differs from restore, in that you can specify 
      new file descriptors, rather than simply accept the old ones.

                   FILE SYSTEM UTILITIES

General Description

     BSYS's ability to "run" the file system structure (tape directory 
   too!) allows the implimentation of virtually any utility function 
   desired.

COUNT (directory file pages)

   What count does

        Count proccesses a single directory or the entire file system 
      and adds up the number of disk pages in use and produces a report 
      of counts by user. As an option it will update the working count 
      in the directory overhead block. This option is particularly 
      usefull when enforcing the disc allocation option in TENEX 
      versions 130 or later.

   How to run count

      counting a single directory

         @BSYS<CR>

               ;count listing the working count (in the
               ;directory overhead block) is updated.
         entire file system? No
         directory: DIRECTORY-NAME
               ; BSYS now types (on the controlling tty)

         max= #
         *
            ; the number following the word "pages" is The working
            ; count and only appears if its different than the
            ; actual count.

DISMOUNT (magtape directory)

     This BSYS function is intended for fixing magtape directories and 
   should not be used except by knowledgable systems people.

LIST (magtape directory)

   What list does

       The listing function produces a directory listing for any bsys 
      dump tape.

   How to do a list

      @BSYS<CR>
      *L<ALT>ist (magtape directory)<CR>

OCTAL PRINT (of directory)

   What octal print does

        OCTAL produces a formated dump of either a system directory or 
      a magtape directory. The dump produced is ala DDT and is quite 
      usefull in repairing smashed directories or simply verifying 
      something about a directory. Try it you'll like it.

   How to do an octal print

      @BSYS<CR>
      *O<ALT>ctal print (of directory)<CR>

       ; if no is specified the following in omitted
      enter tape unit (mtan:) MTA#:
      listing to file: LISTING-FILE-NAME (ie: LPT:, TTY:...)
      directory: DIRECTORY-NAME
      *

TRIM (user directories)

   What Trim does

        Trim will process a directory (or all the directories in the 
      file system) and delete all but the specified number of versions 
      of each file in that directory. If "n" is greater than one BSYS 

BSYS - TENEX Backup SYStem                          - 18 -
OPERATORS MANUAL


      reains the n-1 most recent versions and the oldest.  However, 
      Trim does not expunge these files.  That is done in a separate 
      operation.

   How to do a trim

      @BSYS<CR>
      *T<ALT>rim (user directories)<CR>
      enter versions to retain: n<CR>
       really? Y<CR>
      *E<ALT>xit<CR>
      @RESET<CR> 
      (In the above, "n" is the number of versions to be left 
      undeleted.  Usually this number is 1 (one).)

VERIFY (user directories)

   What Verify does

        Verify checks all the pointers in the FDB (File Description 
      Block) for every file in the directory.  If these pointers are 
      not correct, BSYS cannot correct the problem, but will print an 
      error concerning it.  The conditions checked by BSYS are 
      different from those checked by CHECKDSK.

   How to do a verify

      @BSYS<CR> 
      *V<ALT>erify (user directories)<CR>
      entire file system? Y<CR>

                       ERRORS/ACTIONS

  Following is a list of errors that may be encountered using BSYS. 
Corrective action is supplied if applicable. Normal error format is:
   "label: ...error text..."
label: is the BSYS program label preceding the error and is meant to be 
used as a debugging aid to programmers.
(errors are listed in alphbetical order without the "label")

   ATTEMPT TO EXPAND TAPE DIR BEYOND 20 PAGES
       This is a catastrophic failure and means BSYS is really fouled 
      (contact responible programmer).
   BLOCK SEQUENCE ERROR 
      This error may be ignored execpt when encountered  while actually 
      restoring a file. It is normally caused by tape unit malfunction 
      and you should retry the restore. If the problem persists you 
      should contact the responsible programmer.
   CAN'T GET EXCEPTION LIST FILE - TRIM ABORTED 
   CAN'T OPEN EXCEPTION LIST FILE - TRIM ABORTED 
      The above two errors are caused by BSYS's inability to get the 
      list of directories to except from the trim operation. you should 
      check the file <ARCHIVE>BSYS-TRIM-EXCEPTIONS.;1
   CANT CLOSE ARCHIVE DIRECTORY FILE 
      CLOSF jsys failure and can be ignored. If it happens regularly 
      have someone check it out.
   CANT CLOSE MAGTAPE 
       a random CLOSF jsys failure - no action 
   CANT GET USERS ARCHIVE DIRECTORY 
   CANT OPEN ARCHIVE DIRECTORY 
      Means that BSYS cant get access to a users archive directory. The 
      archive run will be aborted and the BUILD function must be used 
      to make the entries in the archive directory once the problem has 
      been rectified. This error is usually caused by disk space 
      (system or user) shortages.
   CANT GET JFN FOR CONTINUE FILE??
   CANT OPEN CONTINUE FILE?? ENTERING MANUAL MODE
   NO CONTINUE FILE?? ENTERING MANUAL MODE 
   NO CONTINUE RECORD?? ENTERING MANUAL MODE
   FAILED TO CLOSE CONTINUE DUMP FILE??
      All of the above errors signify that something is wrong with the 
      continue dump mechanism. Simply supply the data asked for and 
      continue. BSYS is unable to save the state of the dump while in 
      progress. This is not serious unless the dump aborts and you wish 
      to restart with the CONTINUE command and even then it is just 
      inconvenient. This is usually caused by disk space problems.
   CANT WRITE TAPE HEADER - ABORTING 
      This is a catastrophic failure and should be looked at by the 
      responsible programmer. Most probable cause is a bad tape.
   CLOSF JSYS FAILURE ?? 
       a random CLOSF jsys failure - no action 
   DATA ERROR READING FIRST RECORD OF FILE #  
      This error occurs when positioning a tape to the desired file and 
      can generally be ignored. 

BSYS - TENEX Backup SYStem                          - 21 -
OPERATORS MANUAL


   DIRECTORY NUMBER ALREADY USED ON THIS TAPE?? 
      This is caused by reused directory number conflicts and should 
      only be encountered when "appending" to an old tape. Any other 
      occuance is indicative of BSYS program problems.
   ERROR WHILE WRITING TAPE HEADER
   ERROR WRITING TAPE DIRECTORY - PAGE #  
       The above two errors  are indications of a bad or marginal tape. 
      The tape should be checked for "mountability" and in the event of 
      failure should be copied (see TAPE copy function) or if possible 
      the data should be redumped.
   INVALID DIRECTORY NUMBER FOR CNDIR 
       Indicates an  invalid entry in the system index hash table. 
      contact responsible programmer or TENEX people.
   INVALID FILE DATA (ZERO DIRNUM) 
      The file data record (FDB, filename, etc..) is bad. normally not 
      a problem except when rebuilding the directory (see TAPE copy 
      function).
   JSYS ERROR IN ERROR ROUTINE AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
      ERSTR jsys failure in the BSYS error routine. 
   NO ROOM FOR NAME IN TAPE INDEX!! 
       There is no more space in the tape index. This should not happen 
      and is symptomatic of a BSYS program problem.
   NON-EXISTENT DIRECTORY NO. 
      The DIRST jsys has failed on a valid directory number (tenex 
      problem?)
   NON-EXISTENT TAPE DIRECTORY NO. 
      A previously identified directory cannot be found in the tape 
      index plus the equivalent disk directory does not exist - this 
      should not normally happen and is symptomatic of BSYS program 
      troubles and you should contact the responsible programmer.
   SEQ ERR:  
       block numbers on tape records are not consecutive. This can be 
      caused by tape unit malfunction or BSYS program toubles. In 
      general can be ignored but if cronic should be investigated.
   TAPE DIRECTORY DISAPPEARED?? 
       BSYS attempt to remap a user tape directory failed - 
      catistrophic problem and indicates BSYS program problem.
   TAPE DIRECTORY SPACE EXHAUSTED DUE TO WRITE ERRORS 
       Indicates a Bad tape  - no recovery - you must redump the data 
      on this tape. ( note: in some cases TAPE copy with rebuild option 
      will work!)
   THIS TAPE DOES NOT CONTAIN DATA TO CREATE USERS
       IT'S NOT THE 1ST TAPE OF A DUMP ....
      When reloading the disc the first tape of a full dump must be 
      used first. After that tapes may be loaded in any order.
   TRIM FUNCTION TABLE OVERFLOW: 
      EXPAND TABLE "EXLST" OR DECREASE NUMBER OF 
      DIRECTORIES EXCEPTED  
   UNDETERMINED TAPE ERROR PLEASE CHECK TAPE AND
     TYPE ANY CHARACTER TO CONTINUE

   UNRECOVERABLE ERROR WRITTING TRAILER
      TAPE IS GOOD(?) BUT, NOT FOR FUTURE APPENDS
      TAPE MARKED AS FULL... 
      Bad or marginal tape - no action
   UNRECOVERABLE TAPE READ ERROR 
      BSYS is unable to read the data from a tape.Retry after mounting 
      tape on another tape unit (if available) or cleaning the read 
      heads.
   UNRECOVERABLE TAPE READ ERROR ATTEMPTING TO CREATE USERS
      A read error has forced termination of the create users funtion 
      of restore. Use the DLUSER subsystem to create the user 
      directories and type "no" to BSYS when asked  to create users.
   UNRECOVERABLE WRITE ERROR WRITING DIRECTORY
   WRITE ERROR IGNORED 
      BSYS writes detected error records until no errors occur. this 
      means recovery is possible (beware!).  This usually indicates the 
      tape in marginal at best and redumping is strongly advised.

INTRODUCTION

  BSYS basically runs the file system structure "calling" specific 
function routines for each file encountered.  It does this by mapping 
the system INDEX and copying the user hash table, It then maps each 
user subdirectory into its space and then processes each symbol table 
entry by following the file extension and version chains (see appendix 
"<SYSTEM>DIRECTORY FORMAT"). This allows for multiple functions to be 
performed on a single pass of the file system. However this facility is 
not presently used.

The flow of a typical BSYS command is as follows

     A setup and initialization routine is called by the command 
   decoder/recognizer. This setup routine sets the necessary function 
   flag(s) for the selected command. The setup routine is responsible 
   for getting all neccesary files:(listing device, mag tape, input 
   files, temporary files...). It then calls the routine CNTRL. CNTRL 
   processes the file <SYSTEM>DIRECTORY, getting the "next" directory, 
   and then calling the routine CHECK to process that directory. CHECK 
   processes each entry in the directory symbol table running down the 
   extention and version FDB chains.  The functional processing 
   routines  (selected by function flags) are called for each file in 
   the mapped directory. In order to process a single directory the 
   setup routine needs only map the appropriate subdirectory pages and 
   call routine CHECK.


                     MAKING A NEW BSYS

creating a site specific version

   BSYS currently consists of 11 code files:

       <BSYS>BSYSDF.MAC                definitions
       <BSYS>BSYSIN.MAC                initialization
       <BSYS>BSYSUT.MAC                utilitys
       <BSYS>BSYSCM.MAC                first level command
       <BSYS>BSYSFD.MAC                filesystem processing
       <BSYS>BSYSFS.MAC                filesystem subroutines 
       <BSYS>BSYSFN.MAC                function execution
       <BSYS>BSYSDR.MAC                dump/restore/archive
       <BSYS>BSYSTD.MAC                tapedirectory
       <BSYS>BSYSDV.MAC                device handlers
       <BSYS>BSYSER.MAC                error handlers

     You should obtain the most recent version of the macro code files  
   You must then edit the definitions file "BSYSDF". All site specific 
   parameters appear at the start of this file and the instructions to 
   edit this file are also included. Please follow the convention of 
   giving BSYS files at your site the same version numbers as the

                       ARCHIVE SYSTEM

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

     The archive command is really just a special form of incremental 
   dump with a different criteria for "incrementalness".

   ** IMPORTANT NOTE **

        BSYS dumps a file on two (2) different tapes before it iS 
      considered archived. When it has been archived an entry is made 
      in an archived files directory file. entries are made in the form 
      of a doubly strung list containing BACKUP DESCRIPTOR BLOCKS (BDB) 
      plus name,extension and account strings. This has  created the 
      illusion for new users of the archive not working. As two passes 
      (one each on different tapes) are required before any files are 
      really archived. A standard operational ploy is to run the 
      archive  twice in a single evening to ensure all archivable files 
      are really archived. This is obviously not necessary but none the 
      less is still done.
      
THE ARCHIVE COMMAND
   This command has two basic modes of operation:
      listing mode
           Allows for generating a list of "archivable" files for a 
         specific user(s) or the entire file system.
         It will alternativly concatinate the file <BSYS>ARCHIVE-TEXT 
         and a list of files to be archived for each user and append it 
         to his message.txt file. It provides for mapping files-only 
         directories to "owner" directories.
      dumping mode
           This mode is essentially "dump" with the dumping criteria 
         being has the file been written or referenced in the last "n" 
         days, where n is the run-time selected archival period.
         The additional function of making entries in the file 
         ARCHIVE-DIRECTORY.;1 is accomplished on the marking "pass".


MODIFICATIONS TO THE TENEX EXECUTIVE 

     The following commands have been added to the TENEX EXECUTIVE to 
   support archiving and retrieving of user files.

            or "ARCHIVED ON ARC TAPES NNN AND MMM"
                 If the file is found in the archive directory file
               "DO YOU WANT IT RETRIEVED?" will be asked. If the answer 
               is yes a message will be logged on a special logger. the 
               message contains time and date, filename, tape nos., 
               requestors name, tty, and job number
               the tenex operator must periodically check the speCIAL 
               Logger for retrieval requests.
                 When the file has been retrieved  the user should be 
               notified via the link or notify facilities if he is 
               still on the system, otherwise the operator should use 
               SNDMSG (the MESSAGE.TXT file in your directory) to leave 
               a confirmation message.
         The actual lookup portion of this command is implemented via a 
         high segment file allowing  any subsystem to INTERROGATE the 
         archive directory file.
         


                     FILES USED BY BSYS

 TAPEDIRECTORY.TMP

   purpose:

       This file is the tape analog of <system>directory. it is built 
      and dump(archive) time and is written on the tape after

      completion (as file 0).

   format:

       It is identical in format to <SYSTEM>DIRECTORY with the 
      following exceptions.
         The field "FDBADR" which normally contains the disk address of 
         the index block for a file contains the "tape address" of the 
         first record of the file on tape. This address has the form 
         xwd file#,block#.
            file#  = sequential file number (directory is file 0)
            block# = monotonically increasing tape block number

<ARCHIVE>BSYS-TRIM-EXCEPTIONS.;1

   purpose:

       This file contains directory names that are to be excepted from 
      the BSYS trim function. The file is used at run time to build a 
      table of directory numbers to bypass when performing the 
      system-wide trim function..

   format:

      It is a sequential text file (editable by teco). It consists of 
      TENEX directory names. The directory names may be upper or lower 
      case and must seperated by <EOL> or <CR><LF>,
      (ie: WALLACE<EOL>
           TOMLINSON<EOL>
           ...).
      input is terminated by detection of EOF 

<ARCHIVE>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT

   purpose:

       This file is an input file by the archive "deliver messages to 
      user" function and is used to map FILES ONLY directories to 
      owners.for files only directoies, The list of archivable files 
      will be delivered to the owners MESSAGE.TXT file

   format:

      It is a sequential text file (editable by teco). It consists of 
      directory name pairs. the user directory name must appear first, 
      followed by by the files only directory name , seperated by a 
      comma end ing in cr lf
      (ie: USER,FILES-ONLY-DIR<crlf>).
      input is terminated by the first null entry (two crlf's in a row)

      BDB's are doubly strung. This is done to facilitate 
      reconstruction of archive directories.


                 FIXING SMASHED DIRECTORIES

  The need for piecing directories back together has diminished greatly 
since RST found the garbage collection bug a while back, but it is 
still necessary to perfom this job once in a while. The following are 
some pointers as to how to accomplish this task for new TENEX KINGS as 
well as some old timers. These methods are certainly TENEX version 
dependent, but have remained stable for some time. There are two kinds 
of smashed directories and each requies a different fix. 

   Invalid Pointers, Strings, FDB'S etc..

      This type of trouble can range from very minor (easy to fix) to 
      major foulups of almost everything. A system crash while 
      EXPUNGING a directory is a rather catastrophic event and may 
      dictate following the Absolute Trash solution.
      The BSYS VERIFY function will catch most problems with 
      directories and should be used to "diagnose" the trouble. The 
      output of this function is a list of problems and can be used to 
      one-by-one fix them. The OCTAL PRINT function produces a  
      formatted dump of the directory and is quite usefull in getting a 
      global view of the directory structure as well as the specific 
      data in the directory. To actually fix the bad data you can 
      either use the BSYS MAP function or the MDDT mapdir method (see 
      below).

   Absolute trash

      This situation is caused by a variety of glitches such as bugs, 
      fat fingers, or flakey hardware but requires major surgery on the 
      directory involved. The  basic scheme is to "reinitialize" the 
      directory so that it appears as though it is empty. This means 
      the symbol table is empty and the free storage stuff is all 
      reinitialized.
       In general the files in this directory will be lost or backed up 
      to the last dump. GET into MDDT and

      1. map the directory as follows

BSYS - TENEX Backup SYStem                          - 30 -
PROGRAMMERS MANUAL


         1/ directory number
         2/ -1
         call mapdir$x

      2. initialize directory

         1/ 25         ;most common block size (FDB length)
         2/ 777        ;one page directory
         3/ directory number
         call iniblk$x

      At this point the directory is locked so you must set 
      DIRORG(DIRECT in BSYS) to -1. Also all the attributes 
      (protection, groups, disk limits,...) of this directory are set 
      to the system defaults and must be reset with the CREATE exec 
      command or any other suitable means. You can now reload the users 
      files from valid dumps (be sure the disk allocation is set up!).

   Some interesting data

      symbol table entries must be in ascending alphabetic order

      Account strings have an entry in the symbol table of the form
         XWD string pointer,,100000

      XWD 400100,,25 - FDB header word

      XWD 400001,,# - filename string header word
         (# = string length + 1)

      XWD 400002,,# - extension string header word
         (# = string length + 1)

      XWD -1,,# - account string header word
         (# = string length + 2)
         The second word is a use count



               GENERAL FILESYSTEM PROCESSING

Running The Filesystem

     In the course of running a TENEX system situations arise where you 
   would like to "process" all the files in a given directory or all 
   the directories in the system and perform a "one time" modification 
   or fix. albeit an infrequent requirement BSYS is an excellent 
   vehicle to perform such operations. The command "RUN" is designed to 
   process the file system. Control is passed to the dummy routine 
   .DORUN once for each file. .DORUN is a block of 100 POPJ's and can 
   be used to either patch or assemble in any special functions you may 
   desire. The state of the directory run is contained in a set of 
   cells in BSYSDF (cvf,cef,adrfdb,...) and can be used to get 

BSYS - TENEX Backup SYStem                          - 31 -
PROGRAMMERS MANUAL


   information about the current, next or last file processed (ie: file 
   name, extension etc.).

Mapping directories

     BSYS provides an analogous function to the MDDT call mapdir method 
   of mapping user directories and inspecting or modifying them. The 
   MAP command has the following advantages:
      specify the directory name (not number)
      specify read/write access (a guard against fat fingers)
      ability to use any BSYS subroutines or prewritten user routines 
      to perform fixups etc..
   If you GET BSYS.SAV and go into DDT, put a breakpoint at cell BPLOC 
   then start BSYS (start$g). The MAP command will take the breakpoint 
   and you can do as you wish . $P will continue BSYS and all will be 
   cool. Much thanks to ED TAFT@PARC for contributing this BSYS 
   function.


                    BSYS Magtape Format

  All files consist of "n" records of 514 words and are seperated by 
EOF marks. The first two words of each record have the following 
format.
   
       word 1  lh= not used
               rh= block number
       word 2  lh= file number
               rh= page number
    
   where block number is a monotonically increasing tape block sequence 
   number, file number is the sequence number of this file (directory = 
   file 0) and page number is the page number of the file as it would 
   appear on disk.

There are four special cases for word 2.

   word 2= -1          "unused" directory file block.
   word 2= -2          user data record (for CRDIR)
   word 2= file#,,-1  end of data record
   word 2= file#,,-3  file data record (FDB + strings)

Directory file:

   The directory file is the only "rewritable" file on a BSYS format 
   tape. This file consists of a header record (length= 64 words) and 
   200 512 word "pages". Provision is made for this to be alterable as 
   the number of directory pages is contained in the header record. 
   This file is prewritten by BSYS by positive response to the question 
   "NEW TAPE?". The rewritabilty of this file is accomplished by 
   writting 12 inches of gap (blank tape) at the end of this file at 
   initialization time and subsequently only writting 6 inches at 
   rewrite time. This scheme has been quite successful at SRI as we

   have not encountered any problems due to this process.

   Format of header record:

      tphdr:
      tpblk:   0       ;header is block 0
      tpnum:   0       ;arc tape number
      nxtblk:  0       ;saved last block number used (this tape)
      usrblk:  0       ;block # of 1st record if user data file
      tpspac:  0       ;space left on tape
      tpfils:  0       ;count of # of files on this tape
      blank:   0
      pages:   0       ;count # of pages used

      reservd: block   7
      tptxt:   block   20      ;id entered by operator
       The follow data is site dependent but the length of the header 
      record cannot exceed 64 words.

   Tape directory index:

       Subdirectory zero is used as an analog to the tenex file 
      <SYSTEM>INDEX and is used for mapping directory name to tape 
      directory number and vice versa. It has a symbol table ala 
      regular directories with entries of the form:

         lh - pointer to string block containing dir name
         rh - directory number

       This allows for independance of directory numbers on tape and 
      disk. This solves the problem of deleteing a directory and then 
      subsequently creating another with the same name but different 
      number.

User Data Files (optional):

     This file consists of "n" 514 word records each containing all of 
   the data nessecary to create a directory (GTDIR). This file will 
   only appear on tape created by a "full" or "full incremental" dump.

Filesystem Files:

     These files consists of "n+1" 514 records corresponding to the "n" 
   pages in the as it appeared on disk plus one record containing the 
   directory name, directory number, FDB, and all the strings 
   associated with the file.. There is a one to one mapping between the

   "n" pages and the pages on the disk. There is no zero compression of 
   files ala 1050 save files.

Trailer Record:

     After the last file on the tape (for non-full tapes) a special 
   record is written . This record is used for positional verification 
   when adding files to a tape. This record is simply the first page of 
   the "next" file that would be added with a -1 in the page number 
   field

               KNOWN DEFICIENCIES OR GLITCHES

DEFICIENCIES:

1) The Trim (excess file versions) function should use the "default 
file retention" field as its criteria in deleting files. It presently 
asks the operator for the number to keep.
2) The LOAD command is really only half implimented due to the 
non-support of stars ("*") for output files in tenex. If there is a 
real need for this function it could be accomplished in BSYS.
3) The retrieval of files from the Magtape Archive should be completly 
automated with automatic user notification.  The operator would only be 
required to run BSYS and mount tapes as instructed. This command has 
been pretty well specified and should be implimented for use of BSYS in 
a Commercial environment.

GLITCHES:

1. If you plan to use BSYS and DUMPER concurrently there is a conflict 
in the use of the word FDBBCK (FDB). You must make a mod to DUMPER and 
run BSYS.FAI;102 or newer. The conflict only effects the incremental 
dump function of DUMPER but if you are going to use dumper at all it is 
strongly recomended you make the mod.
   dumper mod:
      page 23 at
      dmplx1+20/ movni b,1   ** replace this instr. with
           move b,[xwd 400000,-1] ;dont use bsys flags
2. The "deliver to users" option of the archive command was designed 
and implimented before the advent of SNDMSG and its resultant rigid 
MESSAGE.TXT file format restrictions. The method used for generation of 
the BSYS archival list makes it difficult if not impossible to supply 
the length of the message in a SNDMSG type header. A possible solution 
is to get MAILER to deliver the messages (since it supplies a header in 
SNDMSG format). This would require BSYS to drop out a file of the type 
MAILER likes and "poke mailer". This seems like a rather round about 
way to get things done and a such nothing has been done.  Thus the 
"deliver to users function" is rather useless in its pressent form  but 
could be fixed if anyone comes up with a better solution or a need for 
its use.
3. The record size of the "user data" record has been changed from 64 
to 514 words. This was done because of a persistent error message when 
working with tapes containing the data to recreate users. This has the 
effect that the restore entire file system function is incompatable 
with "old" bsys tapes. This is thought to be a rather unlikley event 
(to be restoring a non-current filesystem!), but if there is a need to 
do such a thing the cell RWRCRD must be changed from IOWD ^D514,BLKNO 
to IOWD ^D64,BLKNO.
