SA10 DISK PACK TIMER
T. Rindfleisch
10/31/77

SATIMR is a program for checking the seek and rotational times for 3330
disks attached to a PDP-10 via an SA10 adaptor.  It uses the line
frequency clock to time 100 iterations of each operation and so has a
timing accuracy of about 0.2 msec.  No write operations are performed
during testing of the drive except to verify READ ONLY status by
attempting to write in the innermost maintenance cylinder.

Seek distances ranging from 1 cylinder to the full pack (815 cylinders)
are timed at the outer, middle, and inner parts of the pack.

=> OPERATION -  at startup, the program asks for the logical drive
		number to be timed.  The drive must be WRITE PROTECTED
		for safety.

=> PRINTOUT  -  following is a sample printout:

	SA-10 Disk Drive Timer
	Time drive (0-3): 0

	Times are accurate to +/- 0.2 msec.

	Seek Span        Seek times (msec)
	  (cyl)    @Cyl   0   @Cyl 400   @Cyl 814
	   814	     54.2	54.0	   54.3
	   700	     50.0	50.3	   50.0

	     1	      5.7	 5.5	    5.3

	Rotation time = 16.8 msec

	DONE timing drive 0
	Elapsed time 2:21.0 min.

	No errors encountered!

=> Assembly -  SATIMR is assembled straightforwardly and should be
		linked with SAEDDT.  After linking, it should be started
		once for initialization and to set up DDT:

	@START
	DDT

	BUGADR(BUGCHK)$8B
	^Z
